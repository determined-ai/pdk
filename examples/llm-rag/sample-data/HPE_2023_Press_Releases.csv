AI is the “killer app” of this decade. There remain, however, significant hurdles to tap into the promise of this new transformational generation of AI models; training large language models at scale can be prohibitively expensive and stitching together solutions can be time consuming and requires deep expertise.

That’s all changed now with a series of announcements we’re making this week at HPE Discover. HPE is taking an end to end approach to AI so you can unlock the potential of AI for your business. Whether you need to deploy in the cloud, the data center or at the edge, we have you covered. Across training, tuning or inference, regardless if your business demands results in days, hours, or seconds, HPE has a solution that fits your needs. Up first, we announced a new AI cloud portfolio, the first of which is HPE GreenLake for Large Language Models. This solution combines HPE’s AI software with HPE’s market-leading supercomputers to allow enterprises to train and tune large-scale AI models on demand, in a multi-tenant cloud service – privately and sustainably. Unlike public cloud offerings that run multiple workloads in parallel, HPE GreenLake for Large Language Models is architected to run a single large-scale AI training and simulation, and at full computing capacity. The offering will support AI and HPC jobs on hundreds or thousands of CPUs or GPUs at once.  This capability is significantly more effective, reliable, and efficient to train AI and create more accurate models, allowing enterprises to speed up their journey from POC to production to solve problems faster.

Second, we’re bringing to market three new AI inferencing solutions to speed your time to value. These systems are certified and optimized for inference at the edge and in the data center.

HPE Aruba Networking introduces Agile NaaS, the framework for helping customers navigate and implement new consumption and management choices with Network as a Service
With its AI-powered automation and operations interface, the new generation of Central was designed for what is next, including NaaS
No matter how customers choose to modernize their networks, they can gain the benefit of our NaaS innovations while making sure that when they embark on their NaaS implementation, it will be a success ","HPE Aruba Networking introduces Agile NaaS, a flexible new consumption and management framework
Networking, like all technology, is fascinating because it never stands still. The pace of technology change may ebb and flow, but we are in a particularly vibrant phase based on the way technology is now an essential partner in achieving organization goals and business outcomes.

Much of this comes from broad changes in the IT environment, such as the adoption of hybrid cloud deployments and the push to leverage data and compute from the edge to the cloud to deliver the insights that drive innovation. Add in tight budgets, scarce resources, and the need for more predictable IT expenditures, it’s clear the top priority is to automate operations while providing organizations flexible as a Service acquisition and management options. Given that the network is the central nervous system for this transformation, the need for new thinking about the role of networking, how it is architected, and the services it delivers is clear.

Looking back over the last ten years, we started this journey by first focusing on moving network management from on-premises to the cloud. In fact, we introduced Aruba Central in 2014 to do just that.  Then came the “AI generation,” where our huge customer base and the data it generates provided the opportunity to build machine learning-based AI models that are proven to reduce the load on stretched networking teams by cutting the time and effort required for tasks such as troubleshooting and optimization. Now, HPE Aruba Networking Central, which runs on the HPE GreenLake cloud platform, builds on the experience of managing hundreds of millions of end point devices, combined with mature, proven AI to deliver better security, automation, and Network as a Service (NaaS). To introduce this new era, we are making two major announcements at Atmosphere 2023: next generation Central and Agile Network as a Service.  This is in addition to two recent acquisitions that we have made: Athonet for Private 5G connectivity and Axis Security for comprehensive SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and SSE (Secure Service Edge) security solutions.

While those acquisitions provide our customers and partners expanding connectivity and security choices for the next generation of networking, today I’m excited to introduce the foundation for what’s next.  The next generation of Central has been designed to drive business innovation with:
 

AI-powered automation to meet the growing demand for more efficient operations

NaaS to move more quickly and reduce the stress on resources

Rapid introduction of new services, such as 5G, to expand the connectivity footprint

A built-in Zero Trust framework to deliver security solutions such NAC (Network Access Control), SASE, and SSE for better protection.
 
This next generation of Central leverages our market-leading AI to infuse every part of the network management workflow with the intelligence and automation required to keep up with the needs of business. For us, AI is not an add-on, not demoware, but foundational for network success from planning device installation locations on Day 0 to zero touch deployment on Day 1 and then automated SLA monitoring and optimization for Day 2 onward. And to amplify the value of AI-powered operations, the new Central user interface and workflow are tuned specifically to deliver the data and insights network teams need to delight end users and deliver on business requirements. Given this mission, Central and the underlying AI-powered automation are essential to success, especially as organizations consider new models for acquiring, deploying, and managing their networks. That’s why we are so excited about introducing Agile NaaS, our framework for helping customers navigate and implement new consumption and management choices with NaaS to deliver faster business outcomes.

There is a lot of confusion around what NaaS is and how it should be implemented and paid for, with many people pushing “one size fits all.” While monthly subscriptions and flex up/down capacity adjustment are key NaaS attributes, there are many other variables to consider, such as how and by whom the network is managed, how NaaS is introduced and deployed, etc. Agile NaaS helps organizations start with their desired business outcomes and then develop an acquisition and consumption approach that fits their needs. The power of Agile NaaS is that we can combine existing network and deployment approaches with the flexibility to introduce HPE GreenLake for Aruba NaaS at your own pace—project by project or all at once.  With Agile NaaS, we are committed to giving you choices on how to best purchase and operate our solutions.

With its AI-powered automation and operations interface, this new generation of Central was designed for what is next, including NaaS. And we’ve used our customer NaaS experiences from global enterprises to small businesses to guide its design. That is why we are introducing Agile NaaS together with the next generation of Central. No matter how customers choose to modernize their networks, they can gain the benefit of these innovations while making sure that when they embark on their NaaS implementation, it will be a success.

10 insights on leading through change,"March 29, 2023",,"Gerri Gold shares insights from fellow HPE leaders for our customers, partners and beyond, navigating through their transformation
Since HPE declared our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company, we’ve made significant progress in our transformation.  From our strategy to operating model, culture, and brand – we’ve been architects, resetting the way. Recently, I had the great pleasure of hosting a panel with fellow HPE leaders; to share experiences, and converse on how we take our collective skills and talent, break down silos and accelerate our journey.

The advice of my peers resonated with me so much, that I wanted to share those insight with leaders across our customers, partners and beyond, as they navigate their own digital transformation and change management. Here are my picks, some of the standouts from the panel:

1.    Show up every day and be relentless.
As a leader, you need to be relentless in driving alignment, accountability, advocacy, and advancing talent and culture. Sure, it can be exhausting, and some days are tougher than others. But we are a people business: The energy and confidence you bring will have a huge impact.

2.    Build strong relationships and have the tough conversations.
It’s impossible to be aligned without healthy strong relationships, and it starts from a place of trust. We have to constantly be asking for feedback and giving feedback. Be intentional about your relationship goals.

3.    Give yourself time to think about transformation.
Take the time to develop yourself, to learn, think, reflect and on what is working and not working. Tough one, right? But if it’s important, and it certainly is, calendar it! Be disciplined about making time to strategize and brainstorm with your peers.

4.    Try radical transparency.
Share your journey and tell the truth. As a leader, you feel like you have to be strong, but those moments of vulnerability can add huge credibility.

5.    Listen before charging in.
That’s the famous “two ears and one mouth, use in that proportion”! Listen first. Really understand the culture and how people like to get things done, so you can adapt your approach and be more effective moving forward.

6.    Position tough work as a mission, not a burden.
This is one that particularly resonates with me. People hold tough work as a burden or a mission. Taking on a mission translates to people feeling like they are making a difference. Rallying around a goal, with a team effort in place, can sustain that “mission” mentality going forward. The sense of mission can create an amazing forward-moving energy

7.    Recognize that some thrive in change, and some don’t. Lead accordingly so everyone contributes.
In any given team, some thrive in change, others need more time and dialogue before they embrace it. As a leader, you need to mobilize the positive energy, bring clarity to drive change forward, but also address ambiguity or resistance. In fact, some may become your strongest allies in the longer run, once they’ve come out of the change curve.

8.    Know what makes team members tick and tailor motivation.
Get to know what makes your team members “tick” - that motivation will guide how you approach each person differently.

9.    Have the agency to break down silos.
Be willing to have those “difficult” conversations to break down silos and align to the priorities of your customer needs. Engage representation from all relevant facets to show the value they bring, but always keep your strategic direction and your customer needs as primary compasses.

10.    Always be on the hunt for talent.
There’s a lot of hidden talent in an organization. As leaders, we have a responsibility to spot the talent in those that are ambitious about the work, but maybe not as ambitious about advancing themselves. As one of my peers on the panel said: Our job is to look for the folks that don’t raise their hand.  

So many great insights from my peers. I look forward to implementing, or reviving, some of the tactics in my own day-to-day leadership.

When our panel closed, someone stood up in the audience. It was our HPE Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati. He shared his feedback with us, and how he appreciated the felt empathy, and the importance placed on truth. Two things he said will stay with me for a while I know:  “The truth is the foundation of any high performance company,” and “Uncertainty is opportunity. Because there is no comfort in growth and no growth in comfort.” So true!

The reality is, in this complex world we’re in - even more so than in the past - leaders are learning along with their teams – and learning from each other.

HPE opens Cyber Defense Center in Houston,"October 12, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
The Cyber Defense Center serves as our global cybersecurity operations headquarters and houses our incident response analysts
The Cyber Defense Center will serve as a critical training ground, where entry-level team members can sit side-by-side with experienced analysts and learn by doing","Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility between HPE and our customers, partners, and team members, as a single weak link can impact all
Cyber criminals are smarter than ever and use increasingly advanced tactics. To combat attacks, we must be prepared to recognize, prevent and remove threats 24/7/365.

This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we sat down with Bobby Ford, HPE’s Chief Security Officer, to learn about HPE’s newly opened, state-of-the-art Cyber Defense Center at its Houston headquarters, and discuss how the company thinks about cybersecurity.

Q: What does the Cyber Defense Center do?

A: The Cyber Defense Center serves as our global cybersecurity operations headquarters and houses our incident response analysts. 3.5 billion events happen per day at HPE.The team analyzes data using AI, with the most complex cases handled by the team in this room. 

The center also serves as a training ground for new cybersecurity talent to learn and develop their skills alongside experienced analysts and leaders. It’s situated adjacent to our Customer Innovation Center, providing an immersive experience for customers interested in learning how HPE practices cybersecurity. Q: Where else does HPE have cybersecurity operations?

A: The Houston hub is supported by our Cyber Defense Center in Galway, Ireland, and we’re building out a third center in Bangalore India, forming a 24 hour/ “follow the sun” cybersecurity monitoring and response operation.

Q: How was the space designed?

A: We wanted to design a central command center for our new HQ that would serve as a hub for our incident response coordination. The center’s open-concept workspace promotes collaboration, while the adjacent briefing room provides a more intimate space for small group conversations. Interactive touchscreens and enhanced audio-visual capabilities enable our teams to collaborate effectively and share information seamlessly. A lot of highly confidential information is shared in this room, so privacy is of utmost concern. The glass wall between the main area and the briefing room goes from clear to opaque with the flip of a switch when needed. And perhaps coolest of all, the room’s lighting changes during events, with red indicating a highest severity incident, alerting team members and visitors when something serious is happening.

Q: What kind of training do cybersecurity professionals receive?

A: As any CSO or CISO knows, cybersecurity talent is precious, so we do our best to give our team members ample opportunity to develop their skills and grow their careers. We do that in a variety of ways, from funding advanced degrees and certification boot camps to offering hands-on learning through our “gig” program, where team members sign up for short-term projects and gain new experience. In addition, we’ve put a lot of effort into growing talent from the ground up. Our internship and early career programs have proven incredibly successful for years, and our newer Cybersecurity Career Reboot program, now a year old, has enabled us to recruit and develop new talent from often overlooked candidate pools – people with no college degree or cybersecurity experience whatsoever. The Cyber Defense Center will serve as a critical training ground, where entry-level team members can sit side-by-side with experienced analysts and learn by doing.   Q: Is the HPE cybersecurity organization engaged in any volunteerism or community involvement initiatives?

A: Cybercrime affects all of us, and our team members are passionate about using their skills as a force for good. For example, our team recently became involved in volunteering for the CyberPeace Institute, an international organization that aids humanitarian NGOs in preparing for and recovering from cyberattacks. In addition, our Women in Security group provides security awareness education for youth groups and charitable organizations. Their work has helped survivors of technology-facilitated domestic abuse, and more recently is being leveraged to teach survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking how to securely set up their devices and online accounts so they aren’t victimized again. On an individual basis, many of our team members volunteer in their local communities, schools, and churches to teach their neighbors how to be cyber safe.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/10/hpe-opens-cyber-defense-center-in-houston.html,"['How does HPE ensure the privacy and security of sensitive information shared in the Cyber Defense Center?\r', 'What are the benefits of having a 24/7/365 cybersecurity monitoring and response operation?\r', 'How does HPE plan to continue to grow and develop its cybersecurity talent?\r']","["" HPE ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information shared in the Cyber Defense Center through a variety of measures.

HPE launches three climate tech impact accelerators,"September 18, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
This Climate Week, HPE is announcing the launch of three climate tech impact accelerators aimed at diverse founders
The accelerators are each geared to support the climate tech startup ecosystem in a different way","Program aims to leave no innovation unsupported in the fight against climate change
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, in no small part due to how interconnected we are as a society. Our individual actions – or lack of action – accumulate and multiply in impact. The ability to change the destructive trajectory we are on, in which 5 million excess deaths are anticipated between 2030 and 2050, requires a collective effort. Technology has the potential to play a major role in decarbonization, but the lack of investment in climate technology startups, particularly those led by diverse founders, is leaving innovation on the table. In the spirit of partnership, inclusion, and innovation that is part of HPE’s DNA, we are launching three new Climate Technology Impact Accelerators with the goal of helping foster the next wave of innovation to combat climate change and with support from partners in finance, industry, and government.

Each accelerator has its own specific focus on supporting various aspects of the climate tech ecosystem, and all are focused on startups with leaders from diverse communities:

Sustainability Subscribed: HPE has partnered with Village Capital, an organization that supports impact-focused early-stage startups, and Zuora, a software company that supports businesses with recurring revenue models, to provide financial support and mentorship to entrepreneurs developing sustainability and climate solutions deployed as-a-service that are focused on underserved communities. Sustainability Subscribed is geared toward readying founders to attract capital by increasing the investment readiness of their solutions and business models.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Channel Partner Award: NREL and Wells Fargo are working with HPE and a number of electric utilities from around the country to increase the capacity of two Ecosystem Support Organizations which, in turn, will eliminate traditional obstacles that are frequently confronted by founders from underrepresented communities, such as underinvestment, high rates of failure, and lack of access to financial and social capital. Climate tech often lacks corporate and investor engagement as it is deemed too risky. This accelerator will help ensure equal opportunities and de-risk the climate tech innovation ecosystem.

LabStart: Drawing on HPE’s longstanding work with the U.S. Department of Energy, LabStart will extend access to the Department’s state-of-the-art national labs to diverse entrepreneurs to accelerate the development of their climate tech innovations into market-ready solutions. This program will help develop a larger pipeline of talented, diverse entrepreneurs, including those from non-traditional backgrounds. LabStart also aims to reduce friction to commercializing lab technology by helping entrepreneurs overcome structural, policy, and financial barriers. In designing the Climate Tech Impact Accelerator program, HPE is drawing on its long history as a company dedicated to innovation. We know that innovation requires not just support for individual initiatives, but support for a thriving ecosystem of entrepreneurs united in common purpose. And, as our CEO, Antonio Neri, often says, diversity drives innovation. The ecosystem – for climate technology or any other – benefits from the diverse perspectives that can only come when everyone around you doesn’t look and think the same. By lending HPE’s expertise, technology, and partnerships to communities that are too often underserved by venture capital and philanthropy, the Climate Tech Impact Accelerator program is working to ensure that less innovation goes wasted, overlooked, or undeveloped.

How do we realistically achieve sustainability in telecoms?,"April 13, 2023",,"Jeff Edlund, chief technology officer of HPE's Communications Technology Group, explains where we are in our sustainability goals, and what’s next in the industry.
Achieving significant reductions in energy usage and carbon emissions in the telecoms sector takes an attitude change, but more importantly, it’ll take industry cooperation to become a reality. But making climate change goals also requires a technology shift that will drive traffic growth and threaten to push up energy usage.


Where do we see the telecom sector being able to make traction towards sustainability goals?  

The good news for operators is that the investments they make now in equipment and services designed to help them reach their goals will have a much broader, long-standing impact on their businesses.

Most global telecoms operators have detailed plans to reduce emissions in the coming years. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are direct and indirect emissions respectively, generated by fuel usage or the electricity companies purchase to run their networks. Scope 3 accounts for 80% of telecoms emissions and refers to the entire value chain – from equipment produced by the telcos’ suppliers to emissions generated by products and services supplied to end-users.

Naturally, reducing Scope 3 emissions needs cooperation and technology executives are increasingly looking to us to utilize our expertise.
 

How does reducing emissions migrate from an attitude change to a long-lasting impact change?

Currently, HPE is working with Intel to help service provider customers with their 5G rollouts, and a key part of that is helping them to meet their sustainability goals.  Imperatively, taking a data-first approach to the network. This involves putting intelligence at the network edges and only transporting data and communications back to the core when necessary.

Modern software building technologies are also a must. Software needs to be built from the ground up for cloud native services that are deployed as microservices, which are only used when they are needed. There is also a need for efficient programming languages to reduce the burden on the infrastructure, enabling it to consume less energy, and continued innovation in compute infrastructure for power reductions.

 

HPE is one of several companies in the vendor community to be aiming to achieve net zero across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040. How is that happening?

In 2022, HPE required all staff at VP level and above to undertake climate training and, starting in 2023, its executive committee members will have part of their bonus calculation based on them setting low-carbon roadmaps for the parts of the business that they run.

Ultimately for HPE, helping telcos to reduce their carbon footprint will also bring our own down; 65% of our footprint comes from customers using our products.

 

Going back to the industry cooperation needed to make any headway, why is this the differentiator?

This kind of change requires partnership across the entire ecosystem. This isn't just about cost and ploughing more dollars into investment in the network just to get to business as usual. This is about using our dollars efficiently to optimise the things that we do today and for the future – and we’ll find that the investment pays back far more than was ever put into it.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/04/how-do-we-realistically-achieve-sustainability-in-telecoms.html,"['What are the main challenges that the telecoms sector faces in achieving sustainability goals?', 'How can operators balance their sustainability goals with the need for traffic growth?', 'What role do you think technology can play in reducing emissions in the telecoms sector?']","["" The main challenges that the telecoms sector faces in achieving sustainability goals are:\n\n1.

Regulatory barriers: Some countries have regulations that make it difficult for telecoms operator"", ' Operators can balance their sustainability goals with the need for traffic growth by implementing a data-first approach to their networks, utilizing modern software building technologies, and investing in efficient programming languages and compute infrastructure for power reductions. Additionally, they can work with vendors and industry partners to optimize their operations and reduce their carbon footprint. By taking a collaborative and innovative approach, operators can achieve both sustainability goals and business growth.', ' Technology can play a significant role in reducing emissions in the telecoms sector.

How engaged team members create a company’s culture,"April 17, 2023",,"HPE is creating spaces for team members to thrive, in life and work
One year ago this month, HPE officially opened the doors to its new Houston headquarters. It was always our vision to create a next-generation collaboration and culture center that meets the evolving expectations of our teams, especially in this new world of work flexibility. And, although biased, I can say I think we have accomplished that.

We centered our headquarters around fostering teamwork and social interaction, and being able to accommodate team members' changing needs. It’s important to note that even though we headquarter in the Lone Star state, we have more than 200 sites across 60 countries that offer a supportive and collaborative environment, with the flexibility to make work fit their life instead of the other way around, improving productivity and customer outcomes. Most of our sites are designed to provide spaces in which team members can have fun and brainstorm in non-traditional settings.

In Houston, team members can literally build relationships via an onsite Makerspace or learn about honeybee conservation via our rooftop bee apiary that we partner on with Hives for Heroes, which helps foster a healthy transition from military service.

This month, we also hold our annual Team Member Appreciation Day, worldwide. An event like this takes the hard work of site leadership and team members that volunteer their own personal time to make these events memorable. More than 130 of our sites are hosting activities for team members and those who aren’t on site are invited to attend virtual activities.  It will be the first time in three years where we have dedicated site events for our team members to celebrate together in-person. Team Member Appreciation Day is our way of showing appreciation for everything our team members do in support of HPE’s success – and we’re following the day with a full-day wellness Friday, where everyone has an entire day off.

Our hope is to continue to lead the market in technology, and lead in creating a culture that other companies will want to emulate. In my opinion, both go hand-in-hand – it’s almost compulsory to have fun with the people you work with to excel as a company. So much so, that HPE again made the 2023 Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list.

Whether in Houston or around the globe, our team members are our greatest asset, and we strive to keep them motivated and feeling appreciated yearlong.

HPE completes acquisition of private 5G leader Athonet,"June 16, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
Adding Athonet to HPE’s offering primes us for a key position in the fast-growing private cellular market
With the integration of Athonet, HPE will offer a holistic, straightforward approach to deploying private 5G
HPE’s international sales team and global partner network can accelerate Athonet’s private network deployments on a huge scale","Addition bolsters HPE’s position in wireless connectivity, enabling telcos to unlock new revenue streams and helping enterprises accelerate private cellular deployments
I am thrilled to announce that as of June 15, HPE has completed its acquisition of Athonet, a leading private cellular networking specialist. This acquisition signifies a major leap forward for HPE in our mission to revolutionize the private networking market, in part through simplifying and accelerating the deployment of private 5G.

I fundamentally believe that the true value of 5G lies with enterprises rather than consumers. The billions of dollars spent on acquiring spectrum and deploying 5G networks will not be covered by consumer customers, instead the opportunity lies with enterprise use cases. Private 5G is by far the most exciting enterprise use case for 5G, offering high levels of coverage, reliability and mobility that augments the cost-effective, high-capacity connectivity provided by Wi-Fi. In our view, bringing private 5G and Wi-Fi together is the future of enterprise connectivity. With its robust track record of more than 450 deployments across diverse sectors including healthcare, transport and logistics, utilities, and government, Athonet strengthens our leadership in the blossoming private cellular market. Athonet’s robust and innovative solutions have earned the company high regard and trust among enterprises, analysts, vendors and telcos alike. In the months since we announced our intention to acquire Athonet, HPE customers have expressed a great deal of excitement over the prospect of adopting Athonet’s award-winning technology.

Now adding Athonet, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, to our offering immediately primes us for a key position in the fast-growing private cellular market. According to IDC, the private cellular market is expected to be worth over $1.6 billion by 2026 for core networking alone1.

With the integration of Athonet, we will offer a holistic, straightforward approach to deploying the connected edge, helping telcos service this growing market and giving enterprises the confidence to leverage this technology. Our comprehensive private 5G, managed Wi-Fi, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), and edge compute portfolios positions us perfectly to empower both telcos and enterprises on their private networking journeys.

My team is ready to hit the ground running taking our new expanded offering to a global market. HPE’s international sales team and global partner network can accelerate Athonet’s private network deployments on a huge scale. For many years, Athonet has been recognized for its industry-leading technology, and now with the global might of HPE behind it, I am excited at the growth opportunities in front of us.

An immediate opportunity I see is with our telco customer base. One of the paramount challenges telcos have faced over the years is generating new revenue from their networks. The monetization of network infrastructure has become increasingly complex as hyperscalers continue to extend their footprint into the telecom space. Telcos need to find ways to create value beyond basic data delivery and unlock new revenue-generating services.

The emergence of private 5G networks presents a remarkable opportunity for telcos, with enterprise customers demanding customized 5G experiences that offer low latency, increased reliability and extended range. I passionately believe that HPE is the partner that telcos need to take advantage of this growing market.

HPE is setting the stage for tremendous growth and innovation in the private networking portfolio by integrating Athonet’s expertise into our existing telco and HPE Aruba Networking enterprise offerings, and leveraging HPE’s global sales and partner ecosystem. This acquisition is a powerful statement of our commitment to extending our leadership in edge-to-cloud solutions.

We're delighted to welcome Athonet to the HPE family, and look forward to driving digital transformation for our customers from edge-to-cloud.

The future of private networking is here, and we're ready to lead the way.

The superpowers of AI come with great responsibility,"July 10, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
AI will create superpowers for those who tap into it, fueling tremendous advancements for business and society, but with these great superpowers comes great responsibility
Business and government leaders must work together to reap the benefits of AI without compromising data privacy, sustainability, or responsibility","At HPE, we believe AI must be sustainable, responsible, and enable data privacy
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is clearly becoming an integral component of our future, including its ability to turn questions into discovery, insights into action, and our unlimited imagination into reality. AI will create superpowers for those who tap into it, fueling tremendous advancements for business and unlocking the solutions to some of the most pressing societal challenges we face, including climate change, the energy transition, and disease.

But with these great superpowers comes great responsibility. In the race to apply AI, organizations run the risk of relinquishing control of their data and privacy, potentially compromising their long-term competitive advantage. Given the amount of energy required to power AI, those same enterprises may also increase their carbon footprint. And without an intentional strategy around the responsible use of AI, businesses may not apply AI ethically or in line with their values.

So, how can businesses and society reap AI’s benefits while avoiding the repercussions that may come with it?

AI Can Unlock Innovation to Solve Societal Challenges

AI will increase the velocity of innovation across every industry. It has already begun to usher in a new scale of productivity and enable us to break new boundaries, and its abilities are nearly limitless.

For example, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, scientists immediately turned to supercomputers to accelerate research using AI to better understand and combat the new virus. The scientists created a detailed 3D model of the spike protein to understand the strain and test it for potential drug interactions. Leveraging AI, the team accelerated calculations from 24 hours to just eight minutes, allowing them to run 1.2 million experiments per day.  This saved thousands of hours, millions of dollars and countless lives.

AI can also be used to assist a wind farm designer to optimize their models to harness more power for homes and buildings. It can transform the role of first responders by enabling them to predict and mitigate the impact of catastrophic weather events through sophisticated digital twin modeling. It can even revolutionize weather modeling on climate change, accelerate the quest for nuclear fusion, and more.

However, business and government leaders must work together to reap the benefits of these innovations without compromising data privacy, sustainability, or responsibility. Data Privacy Becomes Even More Critical

Data is the new currency that powers the digital economy. The key to success is extracting value from it. AI is an ideal tool to accomplish this, but organizations must pursue AI in a way that leverages their data privately to avoid diminishing its value. Customers should choose an AI cloud provider that does not use customer data to train its own models or use the data as a product to be resold or utilized with other offerings.

Through HPE’s AI cloud, HPE GreenLake for Large Language Models, we enable users privately train, tune and deploy their own models, utilize pre-trained models of partners, or establish domain-specific LLM capabilities using their own data without trepidation about leaking intellectual property or other sensitive data. 

Managing the Environmental Impact of AI

As companies pursue net-zero targets, CIOs face increasing pressure to meet sustainability goals that consider and address the increasing desire to use power-hungry AI systems. From training to tuning to inference, the amount of energy required to use AI is enormous and will continue to grow.

As an example, researchers from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, recently investigated the model training process for natural-language processing and learned the process could emit more than 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent. That’s equal to nearly five times the lifetime emissions of an average American car.

The rapid uptake of AI requires us to be more intentional about sustainable IT innovation. While AI holds the promise of helping solve climate change, we must avoid it contributing to that problem. We must address energy consumption at every level – and organizations must embed it into their AI strategies from the start.

That means using more sustainable data center and colocation designs that leverage renewable energy sources, such as green hydrogen or solar power and wind power – as well as liquid cooling of the computing systems.  The warm water created by the liquid cooling waste can be used for growing produce in greenhouses or heating homes – which can make the footprint carbon negative.

It also means more efficient AI and infrastructure innovation to optimize the use of resources – the faster the supercomputer, the more efficient use of time and energy is deployed to run AI models. HPE has great experience in this space; HPE Cray supercomputers represent 6 of the top 10 supercomputers on the GREEN500 list, which ranks the 500 most energy efficient supercomputers in the world. A Commitment to Using AI Responsibly

While AI has the potential to solve some of society’s biggest, most pressing challenges, we must harness and govern the power of AI in an ethical and responsible manner. HPE believes AI must be:

 

Privacy-enabled and secure – respect individual privacy, be secure, and minimize the risk of errors and unintended, malicious use. 

Human-focused – respect human rights and be designed with mechanisms and safeguards, such as human oversight to prevent misuse.

Inclusive – minimize harmful bias, ensure fair and equal treatment and access for individuals.

Responsible – be designed to enable responsible and accountable use, allow an understanding of the AI, and enable outcomes to be challenged.

Robust – be engineered to build in quality-testing, include safeguards to maintain functionality, and minimize misuse and impact of failure.
 
Every enterprise that seeks to use AI should establish an internal oversight group that understands and can help create guiding principles, evaluates use cases and technologies, and has the technologies in place to make assessments on ethical issues.

Designing a Brighter Future with AI

AI will be the most disruptive technology of our lifetime, and 2023 will be remembered as a historic technology inflection point. We must lean into AI to fuel the societal advancements it will make possible – while remaining vigilant in mitigating its risks.

It is incredible how much the world has transformed in recent years, and I maintain my optimism and confidence in a bright future accelerated by the superpowers of AI.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/07/the-superpowers-of-ai-come-with-great-responsibility.html,"['How can businesses ensure that they are using AI in a way that respects data privacy and security?', 'What are some examples of how AI can be used to address societal challenges such as climate change and disease?', 'How can organizations measure and track their progress towards sustainable AI practices?']","[' Businesses can ensure that they are using AI in a way that respects data privacy and security by implementing the following measures:\r\n\r\n1.

HPE helps India improve healthcare with eHealth Centers,"March 21, 2023",,"300+ eHealth Centers in 22 states, serve six million+ citizens; and help eradicate rare diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and measles
India is home to more than 1.4 billion citizens and 14,000 HPE team members and while India has one of the largest Healthcare Systems in the world. There are still gaps in care, especially in rural areas and underserved communities. When routine healthcare became a crisis situation during the Covid pandemic, HPE had the systems in place to help. We asked, Ankur Malhotra, Director of Corporate Affairs and Corporate Social Responsibility, to speak to us about HPE’s impact in India during the pandemic and what’s next.

How did HPE become involved in eHealth Centers in 2012?

At HPE, we believe in transforming not only the way people work but also how they live. Our eHealth initiative was based on this vision. In 2012, our PointNext team was working on several solutions for the healthcare sector and had designed an open-source, cloud-based eHealth application which was adopted by the Corporate Social Responsibility team to deploy our first version of eHealth Centers. The idea was to provide quality healthcare to the most vulnerable section of our society and fill the void that exists in India with regards to primary healthcare.

How soon did we realize the centers needed to change from routine patient health to pandemic response?

In May 2020, we realized that our traditional eHealth Centers can play a role in mitigating the effects of Covid which was raging across India. Most hospitals were swamped with Covid patients and people with non-Covid diseases were being turned away from the hospitals. The public health ecosystem of the government was stretched to its limits. The need was to fill in the gaps which were created due to Covid, especially around outpatient treatments and testing. That was the time we started working with various government agencies to reorient our eHealth Centers into isolation centers and testing labs.

It took just over two months for HPE to design and deploy Covid-19 vaccination centers, what was that process like?

We were already working with the Institute for Genomics & Integrated Biology (IGIB) for our eHealth Centers, which is also the nodal agency for defining various protocols for Covid in India. They became our guide to design the Covid outpatient departments and test labs. We deployed 10 units to start with, designing them while being mindful to the ever-evolving Covid protocols.

By end of 2020, when the vaccination programs across the world were picking up momentum, we consulted IGIB again to see how we could contribute to the upcoming countrywide vaccination program. Once again, our existing network of eHealth Centers were evaluated, and we proceeded with converting them into vaccination centers using the guidelines issued by IGIB and other governmental agencies. As all our existing eHealth Centers were already cloud-enabled and had a biometric-enabled application running, so we were also able to seamlessly integrate with the CoWin network, the Indian government’s platform to digitally track vaccination status against common preventable diseases.

The technology implemented in the health centers can be integrated into any healthcare ecosystem and are reconfigurable for post-Covid health care needs. Is this currently happening?

Yes, it is. We have already reconverted several vaccination centers back into eHealth Centers with additional tech and equipment. We are also building linkages with governmental eHealth platforms like e-Sanjeevani to ensure that our network is fully integrated with the national public health infrastructure. In the coming months, more than 500 eHealth Centers will be fully functional and integrated into the national health pipeline.

What is next for our part in serving the underprivileged in India?

We are working with the United States Agency for International Development to utilize our eHealth Centers for tuberculosis detection and diagnosis. We are also creating a new concept called Health ATMs which would be a condensed version of our eHealth Centers. These Health ATMs would be able to support more than 50 diagnostic tests, have provisions for telemedicine and can be deployed anywhere, quickly. The idea is to reach those remote locations where traditional healthcare infrastructure does not exist today.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/03/hpe-helps-india-improve-healthcare-with-ehealth-centers.html,"[""How has HPE's involvement in eHealth Centers impacted the healthcare system in India?\r"", 'What are the challenges faced by HPE in deploying eHealth Centers in rural areas and underserved communities?\r', ""How has HPE's technology helped in the fight against rare diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and measles?\r""]","["" HPE's involvement in eHealth Centers has had a significant impact on the healthcare system in India.

"Get to know Monica Batchelder, HPE’s Chief Sustainability Officer","April 24, 2023",,"Monica Batchelder, HPE’s Chief Sustainability Officer, talks leadership, her passion for the environment, and how HPE is helping customers on their sustainability journeys
We had a chance to sit down with Monica and find out why she believes HPE is positioned to create a positive impact through sustainable technology. Did you always aspire to be a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)?

Becoming a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) was never part of a “master plan”. In fact, the role didn’t even exist when I was growing up, but my father encouraged me to be curious, to enjoy learning, and to spend time learning about the things that I was passionate about. Looking back, taking a more circuitous route to where I am today has proven to be a real asset in my job. That’s because CSOs need to employ a multidisciplinary approach to what we do. We need to make a challenge relevant to different stakeholders and drive innovation by connecting dots in new ways. We also need to be able to influence and gain buy-in without necessarily having formal authority. So, having had a diverse background really helps me work effectively between groups and cross-functional teams. In the end, investing time on the things that fascinated me has given me a breadth of experience that enables me to consider a challenge from multiple perspectives, and the ability to work with experts across multiple subject areas.  Where did your interest in sustainability begin?

I grew up in San Francisco, with a passion for the outdoors, spending time hiking, backpacking, and skiing. Looking back, that is what led me to pursue environmental science—long before I recognized that corporate sustainability could be a career, much less an imperative. What keeps me going is working with and learning from a diverse and dynamic team every day who share the deep sense of purpose, possibility, and responsibility that I do.

What excites you about being a sustainability leader within the technology sector?

The work we do is not only transforming our own business, it’s helping others advance their own sustainability missions. I’m proud to work at HPE because I truly believe that technology and innovation are the best and biggest ways that we can create a positive impact. The magnitude of the challenges facing the planet today requires the kind of rapidly scalable innovation only technology can deliver, and will require urgent, collaborative action from all sectors. As a global technology vendor in today’s digital-first economy, HPE is uniquely positioned to help reduce the footprint of IT while expanding the positive transformative impacts that technology can deliver.

What are some of the most significant levers that HPE can pull to address climate change?

We’re really focused on delivering sustainable IT solutions to our customers because this is ultimately where we can have the most significant impact toward our ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2040. Of course, our first priority is to minimize the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over which we have direct control – those that result from our company operations. However, these emissions actually comprise only a small share of our carbon footprint. Ultimately, we can only achieve our goals through strong, innovative partnerships— partnerships upstream with our suppliers and theirs, with our customers, and even with our peers and competitors to drive the industry transformation necessary. It’s invigorating to see how all these stakeholders—within and outside of HPE—are joining together to tackle the incredible challenge and opportunity that climate change poses.

Is there anything unique about your leadership style that you bring to the role?

I focus on using cross-disciplinary thinking and leverage my background in communications to help every person in an organization, no matter what their job, understand the relevance and significance of sustainability to their position. If everyone in the company can see how we can move the needle on sustainability, even a little bit, the collective impact really makes a huge difference. Since taking over as Chief Sustainability Officer last year, are there any specific focus areas that you’ve been driving?

An area I’ve been really focussed on driving has been to enhance and expand the sustainability expertise of our global workforce, especially of our sales teams. With the significant uptick in customer interest in sustainability, we knew that we needed our sales teams to be able to proactively identify opportunities where customers could achieve sustainability gains. Relying solely on our dedicated sustainability technologists in the Living Progress organization meant that we were missing opportunities in situations where sustainability simply had not been considered within the scope of the customer brief. Knowing how many of HPE’s technology solutions inherently carry sustainability advantages, I wanted to arm our sales teams with the knowledge and skills they needed to be able to present sustainable IT solutions early on in customer conversations – so that HPE had an opportunity to showcase not only how our technology contributes to our customer’s business benefits, but HPE’s commitment to sustainability as well. I’m really proud that my team has been at the forefront of taking sustainability from a box-ticking exercise to being a true differentiator in the marketplace that allows us to grow our business.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/04/get-to-know-monica-batchelder-hpes-chief-sustainability-officer.html,"['Can you tell us more about the role of a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) and the responsibilities it entails?', ""How do you see HPE's role in driving innovation and reducing the footprint of IT in the technology sector?"", 'Can you share some examples of successful partnerships that HPE has formed with suppliers, customers, and peers to address climate change?']","["" The role of a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) is to lead and drive sustainability initiatives within an organization.

Today, HPE reported second quarter financial performance, and I am delighted that we continue to deliver strong results. In a market that continues to be dynamic, we delivered exceptional profitability. This demonstrates that our strategy to pivot our portfolio to higher-growth, higher margins areas is working, and we are operating with strong discipline. Here are a few highlights from the quarter:

 

HPE grew revenue 9%(1) year-over-year to $7.0 billion.

We achieved exceptional profitability in this fiscal quarter, generating our highest non-GAAP gross margin(2) ever and a non-GAAP operating margin(2) of 11.5%.

Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share(2) rose 18% year-over-year to 52 cents.

We raised GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance for the full fiscal year, reflecting continued confidence in our strategy and operational discipline.
 

Positioned in relevant markets to meet our customers’ needs

The strategic diversification of our portfolio is a clear strength in winning the business of customers who are taking a data-first approach to modernize their IT estates. The relevance of our strategy at the edge, in hybrid cloud, and in AI – delivered through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform – is enabling us to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. Our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform continues to power the growth of our software, infrastructure, and services, capturing more than $10 billion in total contract value for the first time. HPE GreenLake also drove our annualized revenue run-rate (ARR)(3) to $1.1 billion – with an increasing portion of ARR coming from margin-rich software and services.

We continue to innovate on the HPE GreenLake platform. To complement our organic innovation, earlier this month we completed our acquisition of OpsRamp, whose hybrid digital operations management solutions have enhanced our HPE GreenLake platform by providing visibility, observability and control across multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments. With the integration of OpsRamp technology into HPE GreenLake in Q3, we entered a $39 billion IT Operations Management market(4).

HPE GreenLake is a performance driver across our portfolio, and we are seeing its value across our business segments. In nearly all of our key segments during the second quarter, we produced year-over-year revenue growth.

Continued performance at the edge

Intelligent Edge had a stand-out quarter. HPE Aruba Networking has exceeded our revenue and margin expectations, in part because customers are adding more cloud software services to recently delivered infrastructure, which will add to recurring revenue in future quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in revenue in this segment, and the eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.

We continue to drive innovation and expand our addressable market at the edge. Through our acquisition of cloud-security provider Axis Security, we have expanded our SASE – Secure Access Service Edge – offering, and with the soon-to-close purchase of Athonet, we are doubling down on private 5G. The combination of Axis Security, Athonet, and our world-class HPE Aruba intelligent edge capabilities gives HPE one of the most comprehensive, connected edge portfolios in the market.

Bees are smart. How is tech making them “smarter”?,"May 24, 2023",,"HPE’s Houston headquarters is home to tens of thousands of workers. Worker bees, that is. 
Busy at work, atop HPE’s headquarters, is a workforce unknown to many who work in the same building. A workforce made up of six beehives, producing honey, for good. In the same building that leads tech, for good. Amanda Pena, Houston Customer Innovation Center Manager, shares more on the bees purpose, and how tech helps keep the them thriving.

How did this project come about? What was the inspiration?

I have always been passionate about the environment but never thought of how I could make a difference beyond my home. When we opened the new global headquarters in Houston, I noticed we were getting a variety of bees visiting the plants on our terrace. Another HPE employee asked, “What do you plan to do about those?” and I jokingly replied, “Bring in more!”

Our regional catering director told me about Hives for Heroes, a national military veteran non-profit organization, focusing on honeybee conservation and a providing veterans a healthy transition from military service.  As the wife of a Marine veteran, their mission is very near and dear to me. This project is sponsored by Dr. Renee Pizarro, Digital and Commercial Sales Sr. Director, and HPE’s Veterans Resource Group. We all partnered together with Hives for Heroes to make this project come to life.  What is the purpose of having a bee apiary atop HPE’s Headquarters?

At HPE we often hear messaging about being a force for good. I felt this would be a great way to demonstrate our culture and caring while introducing more pollinators to our ecosystem. You don’t normally think corporate and bee keeping or technology and bee keeping - but why couldn’t I change that point of view? HPE is utilizing technology to make the bees “smarter,” how?

This became an urgent pursuit for me when two of our hives lost their queens. The queen is a vital part of the hive and despite the workers and all the extra eggs, the colony could still die if the queen is lost. At this time of the year, there are no options for us to purchase a queen so I kept asking myself, “If I could have detected those queens were in distress, could I have changed my current situation?” What we know is the queen buzzes at a different pitch than the rest of the hive. Audio sensors with AI could have picked up on her stress or detected her absence much sooner.

Being a tech company, I wanted to tap into what we do best. We have been working with the HPE Ezmeral team and using data to upgrade our hives to “smart hives.” Sensors and data allow for remote assessment to monitor the health of the hives between beekeeper visits. We also share our data with universities that offer master beekeeping programs to continue mind sharing on the topic.How do we connect with the community and team members in this initiative? What are some of the ways we give back through this project?

Houston team members can sign up to participate and meet our master beekeeper and a “newbee,” a veteran from our community learning about beekeeping. This project also provides an opportunity to uniquely engage in a safe setting with our bees, each other, and our team member families.

A portion of honey harvested will be donated to Goodr (a local food kitchen), and a portion sold at Bayou Brew.  A percentage of those proceeds will be then donated to local charities nominated by the Houston employee resource groups.  

 

What’s next – are there any plans to expand, or other projects in the works?

Yes! More hives, fingers crossed, and possibly scoping how we can help other sites maintain their own hives. We have even had customers express interest in having their own hives after visiting our site.

"Get to know Bobby Ford, HPE’s Chief Security Officer","February 22, 2023",,"Learning more about Bobby's career path, his advice for others, and what he does in his down time
Leading the charge to ensure HPE’s digital and physical assets are always protected is his primary job. Being passionate about football and a stickler for designer shoes is part of his alter-ego.

We had a chance to catch up with Bobby and get to know him a little better.  What is the best thing about working in IT security?

Information security, or cybersecurity, is a really cool field. It’s an industry that's been around for more than 30 years, and it's still at the beginning. It is fast-paced and continually evolving, so there is always more that we need to understand.  This is also why companies continue to invest heavily in IT security.

What advice would you have for someone who wants to get into IT security?

I would say understand how truly broad a topic it is and don't be intimidated by the technical aspects of it.  When you think of cybersecurity, you shouldn't immediately think tech. There are different functions and so many different roles that exist in cybersecurity, and not all of them are deeply technical.

What excites you about working in this field, specifically at HPE?

I believe that we are truly transforming the way people consume and view technology. Being at HPE, we are helping an entire industry transform. Very rarely do you get an opportunity to be part of something this big, and I'm thankful to be here.

What drives you as a chief security officer?

The opportunity to protect our data, to protect our assets, and essentially, to protect our business, is what drives me. People tend to think that security is synonymous with defense. I love that theory because if you are a sports fan, you already know that defense wins the championships.

You’re a self-proclaimed designer shoe aficionado. Tell us more.

I love fashion. I think it stems from my parents.  They were into fashion and made sure we always looked our best at church, the first day of school, and other big events. So, it stuck with me, especially shoes.  I think the most significant part of anyone's fashion is their shoes, and I can tell a lot about an individual based on their shoe game.

How AI is changing the game for Evil Geniuses,"June 6, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
When one of North America’s top esports teams put its analytics on rocket fuel, it turned to HPE AI & data transformation experts
Evil Geniuses is shaping the future of esports ","Chris DeAppolonio, Chief Innovation Officer at Evil Geniuses discusses the transformative impact of AI on the esports industry with Mark Hourani, HPE’s AI and Data Practice Lead
Evil Geniuses (EG), a prominent esports organization, leverages AI to improve team performance. Analyzing large amounts of gaming, video and audio data helps EG enhance team skills, create winning strategies, and discover talented players. Mark Hourani, HPE’s AI and Data Practice Lead, chatted with Chris DeAppolonio, Chief Innovation Officer at Evil Geniuses to hear how it’s done.

Q1: (Mark) Chris, can you briefly share the progress made in advancing Evil Geniuses’ AI program and achieving goals with the support of HPE Services consultants over the past six months?

A1: (Chris) Our first use case focused on combining audio, video, and gaming stats for our League of Legends team. We then proceeded to build a foundational AI & Data platform for future use cases using an HPE GreenLake private cloud platform. The platform, models, and web application we developed have revolutionized our approach to the draft process in League of Legends, enabling our coaches to identify winning combinations and counter opponent choices. When you think of sports teams setting the pace with analytics, the A's, Rockets, Liverpool all come to mind. I think with HPE, Evil Geniuses is in that same breath when it comes to esports.

Q2: (Mark) Can you comment on how our teams were able to move you to the new environment and build out the MVP in just 3 weeks, in time for the playoffs?

A2: (Chris) Yes, it was incredible; a testament to how well our teams have worked together. This is complex work featuring even more complex data. I would add that our team has learned a lot of best practices from HPE experts. This will allow us to be more productive and build new models on our own. The HPE GreenLake platform allows us to build portable code using opensource tools without being locked into proprietary tools, all while being highly cost efficient. This is important for an esports organization as we are dealing with budgets far lower than traditional professional sports teams.

Q3: (Mark) What sort of impact have you seen? Q4: (Mark) Did the draft analysis solution provide added value to your playoffs?

A4: (Chris) Our team analysts found great value in the draft analysis tool, using it extensively to prepare for high-stakes matches. Although our playoff results didn't meet our expectations, the analysts confirmed that our draft choice strategy was correct. Given the frequent updates in game versions and the impact on Champion strength, it is crucial for us to quickly understand these changes and their effect on team composition. With over 160 Champions to consider, it's challenging to compile the optimal combinations, but the tool significantly aids in this process. By collecting data from ranked games and scrims, our draft analysis can analyze permutations and assist us in making the best choices.

Q5: (Mark) How do you foresee the impact of using AI in similar ways to optimize results in an enterprise setting and what are your plans for the future?

A5: (Chris) I definitely see these concepts applying to all companies. Evaluating communications and actions with the intent to improve performance, it just makes sense. Communication is still the backbone for many businesses but a lot more could be done in that realm. We have started talking to HPE about generative AI, reinforcement learning, and other novel concepts. But, unlike other sports teams, we play in multiple titles and so while we have accomplished a lot for League of Legends in a short amount of time there is massive greenspace for AI to be utilized to help our three other teams.

Be sure to join us at HPE Discover and see Chris DeAppolonio, Chief Innovation Officer at Evil Geniuses, live onstage at the Session Spotlight, SL5622, Understand one thing: Digital ambition is only met by reimagining your operating model.

A3: (Chris) While we are still in the early stages of leveraging the solutions, we have achieved tangible results, particularly in recording and analyzing our practice matches. By analyzing the voice comms of our players, we can measure sentiment, emotion, and tone of voice, enabling quick observations and guidance during tense moments.

4 top questions being addressed at Mobile World Congress 2023,"February 28, 2023",,"Tom Craig, GM of HPE Communications Technology Group, addresses four major challenges impacting telcos at the show
1.       How can telcos generate new revenue from networks?

The challenge of monetizing their network infrastructure is one that telcos have been grappling with for years. Technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook continue to expand their offerings into the telecoms space, putting increased pressure on telcos to create value beyond the ‘dumb pipe’ and deliver new services that can generate revenue. The average revenue per user (ARPU) has also plateaued, with consumers unwilling to pay more for a new network, whether it’s 4G or 5G.  Telcos are under pressure to generate new revenue from their networks and boost their top line revenue.

It's no secret that one of the biggest revenue opportunities for telcos is in the enterprise B2B space, particularly with the advent of private 5G networks.  Enterprises are demanding a customised 5G experience with low-latency, segregated resources, extended range and security that complements their existing wireless networks. Telcos are looking for simple ways to deploy private 5G networks to meet this growing customer expectation at the connected edge. The enterprise needs to be convinced that private cellular networks can be efficiently deployed and managed. To do this, telcos need to be able to partner with companies that can help them deliver end-to-end private networks, using cost-effective and best-in-class technology that’s fit for purpose. 

That is what HPE is delivering today – a holistic approach to delivering private networks that make it simple for telcos to service this market, and in turn give enterprises the confidence to leverage this technology. Moving quickly to exploit the enterprise private network market will be crucial if operators want to start turning a profit from their network and their expertise. With the acquisition of Athonet giving HPE one of the most complete private 5G and Wi-Fi portfolios, we are well placed to support both telcos and enterprises on their private networking journeys.

2.       How do telcos reduce network costs?

Achieving greater levels of efficiency across all levels of the network is crucial for telcos to maintain their ability to generate free cash flow and stay afloat in a highly capital-intensive industry.

The capital intensity of telcos has been exceptionally high for decades, with the average Capex-to-sales ratio hovering at around 14% and showing no signs of decreasing. This is due to the continuous doubling of network traffic every 18 months or so, necessitating the addition of more infrastructure to accommodate the increased demand. This in turn incurs additional operational expenses and personnel to manage the new infrastructure. Telcos have tried various measures to address this issue, including outsourcing and network sharing, but these have not provided a significant solution.

However, automation is beginning to revolutionize the economics of running a network. Vodafone’s CTO recently said that automation has saved it €500m in three years. Automation can be achieved end-to-end, from the core all the way to the RAN, with cloud solutions that enable telcos to manage their infrastructure regardless of how widely distributed it is. With the implementation of automation, telcos can realize substantial benefits, reducing costs and catering to the ever-increasing capital demands of the industry.

3.       What is the right cloud strategy for telcos?

One of the big opportunities that telcos are assessing today is the public cloud. IT and some network elements that would have been hosted in a private cloud, can now be moved into a public cloud. Telcos are now determining whether this infrastructure can deliver desired business outcomes.

What many telcos are realizing is that this shift to the cloud offers benefits but is not without its challenges. One major challenge is the loss of control over data since it is no longer hosted on-premise. Another is latency, and the time it takes for data to be sent to and from a public cloud, and processed in that environment. It is for these reasons, that we believe the future for telecoms is hybrid cloud, with telcos using the most appropriate cloud environment for different experiences.

As telcos look to leverage different cloud environments, they want a single pane of glass that gives them full control of the data across their different cloud and IT infrastructures, also with the ability to monitor network performance, such as latency. That is exactly why I’m excited about what HPE GreenLake for Telco Cloud is delivering for telcos today - empowering them to move to hybrid cloud environments, without losing control of their customers.

4.       How to reduce energy consumption at the network edge?

With the introduction of distributed computing, more data is being generated at the edge of the network. While modern infrastructure, like the HPE ProLiant DL110 platform, offers heavily reduced power consumption, to make a fundamental change a rethink in how data is handled is required.  Most power is consumed in the transport and processing of data to get some useful outcome. If telcos and their enterprise clients analyse data at the edge of the network, rather than processing it in a centralized environment, they’re not wasting energy transporting data back and forth that they may not use. Therefore, the overall network becomes more efficient.

Hewlett Packard Labs receives two DOE Fusion initiative awards projects,"September 6, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
Hewlett Packard Labs will have a ground-breaking role in two of the DOE fusion initiatives with General Atomics and the University of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics","Hewlett Packard Labs and General Atomics accelerate commercialization of fusion energy
Meeting the challenges of climate change and building a carbon-free energy grid will require a combination of green energy solutions. Wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear (fission) power will all play a role in creating a carbon-free energy grid that powers the world of the near future. Potentially, humanity will also require energy derived from nuclear fusion – the very power source of stars like our sun, and one that has thus far vexed humanity’s greatest minds. But we’ve made significant progress.

Scientists around the world have gotten closer to finding a way to harness the promising power of fusion. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has recently awarded several multi-million-dollar grants as part of its “machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data resources for fusion energy sciences” initiative. Hewlett Packard Labs (Labs), the applied research organization within Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), will have a groundbreaking role in two of these projects in collaboration with General Atomics and the University of Rochester. These projects will be led by HPE Fellow and Vice President Dr. Paolo Faraboschi, who leads the AI Research Lab at Hewlett Packard Labs. Hewlett Packard Labs and General Atomics accelerate commercialization of fusion energy

The pace of fundamental research in plasma physics must accelerate for scientists to better understand how to create stable conditions in a fusion reactor relevant for energy production. Put simply, a Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) must sustain plasmas at temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius – approximately 10 times the temperature at the center of the sun. Keeping that energy system stable has proved to be one of modern science’s greatest mysteries.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods can help scientists achieve research goals that will help solve that mystery. However, AI workflows are complex and available data are not in a form directly suitable for their use to build AI models for the FPP design and control.

The DOE identified a need to develop infrastructures for managing, formatting, curating and enabling access to fusion data for development of AI/ML algorithms. It selected a multi-institutional team of data scientists led by General Atomics (GA) to develop a Fusion Data Platform (FDP) to advance fusion research. The FDP will provide researchers with access to high-quality fusion data for the efficient creation of reproducible AI and ML models that will support design and operation of FPPs in coming decades.

GA will partner with Labs, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) and SapientAI to create the FDP, which the scientific community will ultimately tap to support rapid advancements in FPP designs. Specifically, Dr. Martin Foltin and his team at Labs will contribute expertise in AI/ML data and algorithms to make large-scale fusion data easier to access and analyze through the FDP.

Labs has developed a Common Metadata Framework that makes it easier to discover data that is suitable for building fusion models. It enables reproducible and reusable workflows to help bootstrap and focus fusion research and advances the development of certifiable models and management of their lifecycles. For mission-critical applications, it is important to capture model provenance (the entire history and processing steps that led to the creation of a model) for auditability and certifiability.

The work with General Atomics is crucial because it will accelerate the commercialization of fusion energy, and the team at Labs is excited to play an important role in helping to achieve objectives on the decadal vision roadmap toward fusion energy. Hewlett Packard Labs revolutionizing Inertial Confinement Fusion with University of Rochester

To build upon the historic fusion ignition breakthrough in 2022 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), scientists around the world have been actively advancing their research in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), or more colloquially “laser fusion.” The University of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) is a leader and a key partner in the ICF program. Scientists from LLE are actively engaged in developing laser-driven ICF technology, and their approach involves targeting multiple lasers at small spherical shells or pellets filled with fusion materials, such as deuterium and tritium, to initiate a fusion reaction. This process of firing lasers to produce large energy is a major scientific challenge, and expensive to setup, which limits the number of experiments. To address this challenge, researchers simulate the system to identify the optimal parameters of the experiment. There is an urgent need to bridge the gap between running computational simulations of this process at different fidelities and the experimental design, which deviate significantly. This requires using the power of AI to transfer the learning from these multi-fidelity simulations to physical experiments to help improve the design.

Labs’ AI/ML experts led by Senior Distinguished Technologist Soumyendu Sarkar will work directly with LLE’s fusion scientists to build predictive algorithms using transfer-learning and Reinforcement Learning. This will help accurately guide implosion design and predict experimental outcomes. The objective is to cost effectively run more laser simulations at different fidelities to advance the speed of research and improve the design of the physical lasers. 

Humanity needs carbon-free energy to continue to propel its evolution and innovation while protecting the planet from the devastating effects of climate change. It will take a variety of energy sources and the greatest thinkers to meet that generational and existential challenge. In these two fusion projects with GA and LLE, Labs will use its AI/ML expertise to embrace its role in securing a better, more sustainable future for all.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/09/hewlett-packard-labs-receives-two-doe-fusion-initiative-awards-projects.html,"['What are the challenges that scientists are facing in creating stable conditions in a fusion reactor relevant for energy production?', 'How can AI and machine learning help scientists achieve these research goals?', 'What is the Fusion Data Platform (FDP) and what is its role in advancing fusion research?']","["" The challenges that scientists are facing in creating stable conditions in a fusion reactor relevant for energy production include understanding how to sustain plasmas at temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius, which is approximately 10 times the temperature at the center of the sun.

Four things to know about the 2022 Living Progress Report,"June 12, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
HPE is committed to becoming a net-zero enterprise across our entire value chain by the year 2040
That makes partnering with our customers a critical part of our journey to net-zero. By accelerating our customers’ digital transformations, we are solving their business and sustainability goals, without compromise","Annual ESG disclosure shows progress and opportunity
Sustainability is inextricably linked to our business strategy and everything we do. Today we are releasing our eighth annual Living Progress Report that outlines our progress and new goals towards creating sustainable and responsible technology solutions – a means of transparency for all of our stakeholders. Our hope is that by continuing to set measurable goals backed with actionable plans to achieve them, we can make real and impactful progress towards our environment, social, and governance objectives. Here are four things you need to know about the report. 1. HPE is progressing on our commitment to become a net-zero enterprise across our value chain. In 2022, HPE made the ambitious decision to accelerate our commitment to become a net-zero enterprise across our value chain by a decade to 2040 in order to act with urgency to address the climate crisis. Our commitment—and supporting suite of targets toward this goal—align with climate science, making HPE one of just two global tech companies with a 2040 net-zero target approved by the Science-based Target Initiative. Our journey to net-zero begins with reducing emissions within our own control, primarily through energy reduction and the transition to low carbon solutions. In just two years, HPE’s operational (Scope 1 & 2) emissions decreased 21% from our 2020 baseline, toward our target of 70% of 2030. To achieve this, we surpassed our 2025 target of sourcing 50% renewable electricity three years ahead of schedule.

2. HPE as a Service (aaS) offerings help organizations digitally transform and modernize sustainably. Over decades we have focused on the environmental impacts of our solutions and have built one of the most innovative Sustainable IT portfolios.

HPE GreenLake –the centerpiece of our edge to cloud strategy, enables customers to consume IT on an as-a-service basis, enabling them to flexibly scale their IT to meet their needs and reducing IT inefficiencies which are a significant source of environmental impacts within many companies.  HPE is continually innovating and recently announced the preview of a new sustainability dashboard on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and a comprehensive portfolio of sustainability services designed to help organizations reduce the carbon footprint associated with their IT estates.  In addition, in June 2022, 96 HPE systems made the Green 500 list of the world’s most energy efficient supercomputers, with Frontier coming in as #1. 

We also help customers benefit from the circular economy and give technology that would otherwise be discarded a new life. Over the last three years, HPE Financial Services returned to active use more than 3.1 million personal computers, 2.4 million servers and compute assets, and 800,000 storage devices. In 2022, HPE Technology Renewal Centers processed ~3.6 million IT assets, remarketing 82% for a second life. 3. Maintaining our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are committed to being an unconditionally inclusive workplace where everyone is respected. HPE continues to advance principles of diversity, equity and inclusion both within its workforce and beyond. In 2022, 50% of our board members identified with one or more diverse groups and found that 96% of team members reported feeling respected at HPE. In addition, we met our goal of increasing the representation of ethnically diverse talent by 1 percentage point year-over-year, and 36.3% of US promotions were earned by ethnically diverse team members, which is four percentage points higher than overall representation. HPE also achieved its goal, for the 2nd year in a row, of increasing representation of women in executive roles (director level and above) by at least 1 percentage point.

4. We operate with integrity. HPE continues to demonstrate that we are a trusted supplier and partner helping companies advance solutions that make big ideas possible. In 2022 we launched three new supply chain responsibility targets related to worker training, worker voice, and no recruitment fee and reached 235,533 workers in our supply chain through our monitoring programs. HPE’s commitment to ethical business practices has been recognized globally through rankings and awards by several reputable organizations including:

Empower your sustainable IT strategy with HPE this Earth Day,"April 19, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
HPE is committed to becoming a net-zero enterprise across our entire value chain by the year 2040
By accelerating our customers’ digital transformations, we are solving their business and sustainability goals, without compromise","Monica Batchelder is participating in a livestreamed panel discussion with other sustainable IT experts from HPE
Earth Day is an annual reminder of the commitments we’ve made to reduce our environmental impact to the planet, to take stock of progress we’ve made, and to continually strive to leave a livable planet for future generations. In today’s digital world, sustainable IT can play a significant role for enterprises to fulfill these environmental commitments, which is why HPE sees sustainability as inextricably linked to our business strategy.

In celebration of Earth Day, I’ll be participating in a livestreamed panel discussion with other sustainable IT experts from HPE to help our customers, partners and team members understand the most pressing sustainability challenges facing IT organizations. My colleagues Tiffani Jarnigan, Director, Sustainability Innovation and Partnerships, John Frey, Chief Technologist, Sustainable Transformation, and Brian Falvey, Vice President of Sales, HPE GreenLake North America, will join me for a robust discussion hosted by Mike Hilton, Managing Director of HPE Canada, about how HPE solutions empower users to take charge of their IT estate’s impact on the planet.

How HPE is helping companies implement sustainable IT solutions

Growing pressure on organizations to reduce carbon emissions has led to an uptick in companies integrating sustainability into their business models and an increase in questioning how they can incorporate sustainability into their digital transformation journeys. With the growing environmental footprint associated with IT, Chief Information Officers are increasingly being held accountable for achieving large emission reduction targets. This is where the decades of expertise HPE has in delivering sustainable IT systems and solutions can support companies’ sustainability agendas. The race to achieving net-zero emissions can only be won together, as our carbon footprints are interconnected in so many ways.

Linking it all together – sustainability strategy becomes business strategy

HPE is committed to becoming a net-zero enterprise across our entire value chain by the year 2040, and a large part of achieving that goal comes from reducing scope 3 emissions, which are out of our direct span of control. In fact, the largest portion of our footprint is generated from customers’ use of our products and solutions. That makes partnering with our customers a critical part of our journey to net-zero. By accelerating our customers’ digital transformations, we are solving their business and sustainability goals, without compromise. We encourage our customers to see value, not compliance requirements, when thinking about sustainability. Becoming a more sustainable enterprise is a catalyst for change and transformation. Companies that link digital transformation with sustainability are 2.51 times more likely to be among tomorrow’s strongest-performing businesses than those that do not. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for doing business, with a growing number of enterprises tying contract awards to the environmental performance of the solutions they’re purchasing.

Shrinking the environmental footprint of hybrid IT

While public cloud offers sustainability benefits, not all apps and data can be put in the public cloud. Analysts point out that, despite the benefits of public cloud, the world remains decidedly hybrid. According to IDC, 70% of apps and data remain in data centers, colocations, and edges, for reasons like low latency needs, data governance policies, sovereignty, compliance, or the entangled applications typical of traditional IT. Organizations are faced with dual challenges: the first being to manage data and workloads across complex hybrid architectures, and the second being to design and operate a hybrid IT system with efficiency in mind that is able to meet the mounting sustainability requirements facing IT today. This is where IT-as-a-service can offer a simplified IT solution that gives users the ability to drive down energy use and save money by optimizing workloads and utilization rates. HPE’s flagship offering, HPE GreenLake, provides customers a cloud-native experience to power their hybrid strategy, while empowering them to reduce their environmental footprint, not only through the inherent benefits of a scalable workload solution, but also through additional environmental reduction opportunities such as HPE’s end-of-life asset recovery program.

By pulling all the levers available to them, CIOs can be the sustainability heroes of their organization – public or private, large or small. That’s why heading into Earth Day, I’m more energized than ever to lead the team of professionals dedicated to enabling every part of our company to contribute to solving one of the greatest challenges of our time: climate change.

HPE showcases security initiatives via the 2023 Cybersecurity Report,"April 6, 2023",,"The HPE 2023 Cybersecurity Report shares how we protect our company and deliver a secure edge-to-cloud experience for customers
Delivering a secure HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud experience is paramount to HPE, our customers and our partners. As we continue to support organizations shifting to hybrid cloud, we see the security of cloud platforms as a shared responsibility, and that takes collaboration. In that spirit of collaboration, we also believe in sharing learnings, ideas, and opportunities with our customers and the cybersecurity community at large.

Our 2023 Cybersecurity Report showcases some of the initiatives HPE has undertaken to meet challenges we all face, such as protecting an expanding attack surface, securing the hybrid cloud environment, providing transparency for stakeholders, and growing cybersecurity talent. The report is also a means to share our expertise and collaborate with the industry on our collective experiences. Below are some highlights from the report.

Facing the daily threats: Similar to other global technology companies, we are a constant target for cyber criminals. In fact, our security operations center logs over 2.6 billion events per day. Our report discusses the threats we face every day and how we manage them – from phishing and ransomware to supply chain attacks and nation-state actors.

It also delves into our increased focus on the edge-to-cloud environment and what we’re doing to protect our customers with a risk-based, compliance-driven approach to data security. The HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform continuously applies more than 2,200 separate security controls to protect customers and their data in real time.

Closing the experience gap: All enterprises are feeling the squeeze of increased competition for talent. At HPE, we’re reframing the cybersecurity talent shortage as an experience shortage and in the report, we talk how we aim to we create - rather than take - talent. Last year, we launched the HPE Cybersecurity Career Reboot program, which seeks talent in unlikely places and is designed to both gift opportunities, and to grow our ranks of cybersecurity professionals.

Looking into the future: Our report provides insights from cybersecurity subject matter experts around HPE on the trends they’re seeing from their unique perspectives. For instance, Brian Schmitt, our associate general counsel, predicts: “CISOs, CSOs, and other security professionals will increasingly be held personally accountable for their failures to provide required breach disclosures or to adequately secure sensitive data.”

Taking action: We share a set of recommendations for building cyber resilience and embracing zero trust within your organization. For example, we believe that enterprises must connect security teams more closely with the business.

"Elana Tyrangiel, HPE’s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, discusses inaugural Human Rights Report","June 27, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
HPE incorporates respect for human rights throughout our organization – starting from the very top
The report explores our approach and impact related to our updated list of six salient human rights risks 
HPE’s Global Human Rights Policy has long been among the most robust in the industry","HPE has published its inaugural Human Rights report, learn more about it by checking out the Q&A below
Today Hewlett Packard Enterprise released our first ever Human Rights Report. We want to win the right way, every day, which means maintaining steadfast commitments to ethics, transparency, and responsible business practices. This report reflects these values and showcases our progress. Implementing strong human rights protections is how we live our values and an essential part of fulfilling our purpose to advance the way people live and work.

HPE’s Global Human Rights Policy, aligned to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, has long been among the most robust in the industry. We also recognize that safeguarding human rights in our value chain is a process of continuous improvement. Over the last few years, we’ve made many improvements to drive our business and industry toward even higher standards. To name a few, HPE:
 

Adopted and operationalized principles for the ethical development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence (AI)

Set social impact goals for our supply chain

Collaborated with peers and other stakeholders to promote worker well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic

Launched an Anti-slavery Volunteering Initiative with non-profits around the world

Built our internal processes for identifying, assessing, and mitigating sales with a potential risk of product misuse
 

We sat down with Elana Tyrangiel, HPE’s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, to discuss the report and HPE’s approach to human rights.

Why are you publishing this report now, and what are some highlights?

HPE’s leadership is prioritizing human rights, and our stakeholders including investors and customers are asking for detailed disclosures on our practices and impact. We hope that this report will not only keep us accountable and push us to continue to better our processes, but also encourage our peers to be more transparent. This report also provides a one-stop-shop for sharing all key human rights due diligence and a way to hold ourselves accountable to demonstrating our progress and effectiveness.

The report explores our approach and impact related to our updated list of six salient human rights risks: responsible product development; responsible use; modern slavery and decent work; responsible sourcing of minerals; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.  HPE has a long tradition of transparency (for instance, see our recently released Living Progress report), and because human rights is a priority for us, a report made sense. 

How does HPE incorporate human rights throughout the organization?

HPE incorporates respect for human rights throughout our organization – starting from the very top. We consider human rights in so many aspects of our business—from how we source materials used in the manufacture of our products, to our customers’ end use of our products, to how we treat and train our own team members. We are also deeply involved with industry groups such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) to harness the power of collective action across our industry and beyond.

How does HPE consider the views of third parties HPE’s in upholding human rights?

The views of third-party stakeholders are always important in how we go about addressing human rights impacts. The most valuable opinions are those of rights-holders, such as representatives of vulnerable groups, who provide meaningful feedback that helps us to continuously improve our processes and adjust our priorities to meet their needs. Recently, we identified and engaged with a series of rights-holder representatives and topical experts to get feedback on our understanding and approach to managing risks to specific vulnerable groups. Their ideas and constructive feedback helped us focus our projects in a more impactful way,  launch our work to understand and drive positive impact through clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a human right, apply a vulnerable groups lens to every human rights impact assessment we do, and inform and improve our Commitment to Respect the Rights of Marginalized Groups.

Workers are also critical partners. We have prioritized worker engagement, introducing new ways to gather regular feedback from workers at key supplier sites. Worker feedback offers invaluable insights into areas such as supplier pay systems, living wages, and the inextricable link between wages and working hours. We also value how independent organizations view our program. A range of organizations have recognized HPE’s leadership on human rights. These recognitions include:

 

First place ranking among global ICT companies in KnowTheChain in 2022

First place ranking in Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) ICT benchmark and placed in the top 5 across all industries (covering 127 of the world’s largest companies) in 2022

96th percentile for human rights and 100th percentile for social reporting in the Dow Jones’ Sustainability Index (DJSI), securing overall second place in our industry in 2022

Five-time consecutive recipient of Ethisphere’s Most Ethical Companies recognition, starting with 2019

Only repeat winner of the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s Stop Slavery Award, 2016 and 2021
 

Recognition by third-party organizations that specialize in measuring processes and reporting helps us make sure we are on the right path. These validate that the programs we’ve put in place are working and help guide us in our journey to continue making progress across our company and supply chain.

How does HPE maintain ethical standards with the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

In 2022, we refined our approach to assessing ethical AI and rolled out AI Ethical Principles training for HPE team members. In 2023, we further advanced this initiative by launching three new sub-committees to help us operationalize our principles for AI we develop (products), AI we source to use (processes), and AI we source to incorporate into our solutions (partners).

AI ethics assessments are at the core of the responsible product development program. We leverage team members’ awareness and internal alert mechanisms to identify potential use of AI internally and in new products and partnerships that may pose a risk to human rights, and our AI Ethics Working Group works with those partners to assess risk and recommend mitigation measures. Our widely promoted training and principles provide an avenue for raising awareness and building human rights by design with product and solutions teams and business partners.As the world keeps changing and new risks are identified, and rights-holders voice new priorities, we work to put processes in place to provide solutions. Our goal is to be a force for good in the world and we believe that responsibility must be taken seriously and upheld throughout our organization and our value chain.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/06/elana-tyrangiel-hpes-chief-ethics-compliance-officer-discusses-inaugural-human-rights-report.html,"['What are the six salient human rights risks that HPE has identified in its inaugural Human Rights Report?', 'How does HPE ensure that its approach to human rights is aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights?', ""Can you provide more details on HPE's Anti-slavery Volunteering Initiative with non-profits around the world?""]","[' The six salient human rights risks that HPE has identified in its inaugural Human Rights Report are responsible product development, responsible use, modern slavery and decent work, responsible sourcing of minerals, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.', "" HPE ensures that its approach to human rights is aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by incorporating human rights throughout its organization, considering the views of third-party stakeholders, and maintaining ethical standards with the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

HPE Financial Services launches new offers for companies leading the way in sustainability,"February 23, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
Force For Good Financing Program available to companies that have a demonstrated commitment to sustainability
HPE Nimble Storage available through HPE Certified Preowned program
Onsite decommissioning service now available for HPE Asset Upcycling Services customers","New offerings aim to help drive circularity and sustainability within IT market
Sustainability and circularity are gaining IT leaders’ attention, and it is a good thing. In fact, IDC estimates that by 2026, 60% of organizations will require their IT equipment vendors and partners to provide end-to-end visibility of their sustainability process.1

At HPE Financial Services, we recognize that now is a critical time for companies to advance their approach to sustainability, and we are working to help them on this journey, with improved IT economics and circular solutions.

This is why I’m happy to share that today, HPEFS is announcing the introduction of a special financing offer available to companies recognized for their demonstrated commitment to sustainability.2

It is also offering global onsite decommissioning services for HPE Asset Upcycling customers and expanding the HPE Certified Pre-owned portfolio with Nimble Gen 5 Storage.

Sustainability is a catalyst for businesses and our first announcement is focused on rewarding companies that have demonstrated commitment in sustainability. HPE is extending incentives towards new, qualified small and mid-sized business (SMB) and enterprise customers that have an ESG score within a pre-determined range of a recognized industry standard index. These organizations can receive special financing rates.2 As part of our ongoing strategy to help drive circularity within IT and reduce e-waste, HPEFS now offers onsite decommissioning services in 31 countries for HPE Asset Upcycling Services. These onsite services securely decommission IT assets for refurbishment and reuse, or recycling. Data sanitization services can be included, which can help customers align with their privacy standards on their own premises. HPE Services or carefully selected partners deliver these onsite decommissioning services for HPE Asset Upcycling Services.

Additionally, the HPE Certified Preowned portfolio continues to expand and now includes Nimble Gen 5 Storage for customers in the U.S. and Canada, with additional countries to be announced subsequently. Refurbished tech is a critical way companies can lower capital expenditures and accelerate IT projects. As Monica Batchelder, HPE Chief Sustainability Officer points out: “Certified pre-owned is a great option since it avoids much of the embodied emissions that a new product would generate. Extending the life of technology is an excellent way of reducing that impact since it was captured in its first lifecycle.”

Sustainable IT is a journey for us and our customers, and HPE is dedicated to leading the industry by offering world-class solutions and services to our customers and partners. These expanded offerings are important to helping customers and partners optimize their IT estate for efficiency and visibility and maximize the value of asset lifecycles. Technology financing can be key to SMBs staying competitive and meeting sustainability goals

Business leaders are facing another year of global economic uncertainty. Nearly 3/4s of US CEOs believe they need to invest more aggressively in digital technologies. At the same time, 70 percent of global tech leaders are concerned about the cost of technology to remain competitive.3

When faced with the costs of digital transformation and increasing expectations around sustainability, SMBs are among the most at risk of falling behind, especially in the current context of constrained supply, high-interest capital, and tighter environmental regulations.

With an eye towards SMBs, as well as enterprise customers, HPEFS Force For Good Financing Program:
 

Delivers special financing to qualified customers that meet a pre-determined ESG score range within a recognized industry standard index2

Favors adoption of the newer more energy efficient products including HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers4, as well as HPE Data Center and HP Inc. personal systems

Offers the option to include HPE’s Pack-and-Ship services to simplify the return process for end-of-lease assets and help drive circularity in their tech estate

Also included in this offer is the HPE Circular Economy Report so the company can track and observe its contribution to its technology sustainability efforts
 

I’ve been in technology financing and services for some time now, and the groundswell of sustainability-focused initiatives in the last few years is inspiring. There is not one conversation with customers or partners where we don’t discuss this topic, and I’m hopeful that as companies and as leaders, we continue to collaborate to accelerate those efforts.

In parts of the world, the adage is to ""water where it grows.” Through initiatives like our Force For Good Financing Program, the plan is to continue growing strong, competitive businesses that are prioritizing sustainability in their long-term business strategies.

Recognizing the world would be hybrid, we introduced HPE GreenLake, and we have made great strides in aligning one integrated platform, one customer experience, and a portfolio of solutions under one brand.  The scale and strength of HPE GreenLake is evident; it supports 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices. HPE GreenLake is at the center of how we implement our edge-to-cloud strategy.

Having laid the foundation for success, we are now evolving our operating model to accelerate our execution, deliver a superior customer and partner experience, and drive growth for the company and value for our shareholders. These changes to HPE’s organizational structure and executive leadership, which take effect at the start of our 2024 fiscal year on November 1, 2023, will further unify our portfolio and enhance the delivery of a true cloud experience for our customers and partners. They will enable tighter integrations that benefit our customers and partners and spark innovation. And, they position us to continue to win in the market.

We are creating a new Hybrid Cloud business unit, to be led by HPE Chief Technology Officer Fidelma Russo. This business will bring together the HPE GreenLake platform with the technologies and services of HPE Storage, HPE GreenLake Cloud Services Solutions and the current Office of the CTO organization. This new group will accelerate our hybrid cloud strategy as we deliver one portfolio of storage, software, data, and cloud services on the HPE GreenLake platform.  Over the past two years, Fidelma has led the team that created the HPE GreenLake platform, which is now the central offering for all of our Hybrid Cloud solutions, and developed, tested, and integrated new services and launched them on the platform. Fidelma and her team also led the onboarding of OpsRamp onto the platform and created an innovation pipeline that has delivered high-demand services like the Sustainability Dashboard.  Fidelma is a customer-centric leader and will continue to bring revolutionary new offerings to bear for our global customers, helping HPE realize our distinct advantage as we pursue opportunities in the hybrid cloud market.

Within the Hybrid Cloud organization, Tom Black will assume leadership of the new Private Cloud team, reporting to Fidelma. For the last three years, Tom has led our Storage business group through a transformation to a data services business – introducing the HPE Alletra portfolio and our first storage as-a-service offerings. I am grateful for his leadership and look forward to the innovation he will drive in this new role to further build out our business in this growing area of the hybrid-cloud market.

Vishal Lall will be leaving HPE at the end of the calendar year. Vishal has held a number of leadership positions at HPE and has made numerous contributions during his decade-long career with the company. His work spanning HPE GreenLake, HPE Aruba, HPE Ezmeral, and Hewlett Packard Pathfinder has had significant impact in driving the momentum and market opportunity HPE is now seeing, which puts us in a very strong position moving forward.

Pradeep Kumar, head of HPE Services, has been a remarkable leader at our company for 27 years. Over the past several months, he has shared with me his wishes to retire from HPE, which he has richly earned. With Pradeep’s retirement, we will now put the key operational activities for all of our products and services under one leader. HPE Services, Supply Chain and Quote-to-Cash will now comprise our Global Operations organization led by Mark Bakker. By aligning and optimizing our systems and processes and streamlining the end-to-end customer and partner experience, we will accelerate digital transformation for HPE and our customers. As I’ve said many times, I’m confident that we can accomplish anything with the right team guided by the right leaders. I believe we have both. I am proud of the progress we have made in our transformation to be the edge-to-cloud company. These new strategic alignments will enhance the integrated customer and partner experience, strengthen our market position, and accelerate our execution.

HPE GreenLake and Joyuus partner to provide health resources for post-partum women,"March 30, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
Engineers Joyce Roosz and Anna Rios-Rodriguez launched an initiative to lend the power of the HPE GreenLake edge to cloud platform to underrepresented startups
Joyuus, a company dedicated to providing digital health resources for post-partum mothers and their caregivers, was selected as the program’s inaugural startup
BIPOC women experience wide disparities in care during the post-partum period","All-women team of engineers helps startups have a purpose-driven impact for new moms
I’ve been fortunate over the years to have had many informal mentors who have encouraged and challenged me in my career. Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am today. Not everyone has that level of support, so when I joined Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I was pleased to see our genuine commitment to unconditional inclusion and an emphasis on increasing the ranks of talented women in technical roles. While there remains work to be done, I’m proud that HPE is among the leaders in this area.

At HPE, we encourage bold thinking and relentless curiosity. We empower team members to think strategically, be business leaders, and contribute to decisions so they can define their careers and have a positive impact on HPE’s direction and success. One way we do that is with Innovation Quest – an annual, global contest for team members to submit ideas that will help accelerate what’s next for HPE. In 2021, Innovation Quest received over a thousand submissions from around the globe. One of the five winning ideas in 2021, HPE GreenLake for Underrepresented Startups, proposed that we can use innovation as a force for good.

The HPE Diversity Startup program was designed by HPE engineers Joyce Roosz and Ana Rios-Rodriguez, to focus on helping businesses that serve mothers, people of color, people with disabilities, and other underrepresented communities excel. The program, which they designed working closely with HPE’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) team, provides startups with credits to use HPE GreenLake services so they can deliver digital solutions to these underserved communities more economically and effectively. The program was built out in the summer of 2021 and a year later The Provdotnet Group was identified as a channel partner to help roll out HPE GreenLake services to startups as part of their Alpha3 Cloud service offerings.Less than two years later, after lots of planning and integration work, a women-owned company called Joyuus was selected as the inaugural startup for the program and was onboarded in January of 2023. Joyuus is a digital health innovator dedicated to creating accessible well-being resources for mothers and those who care for them during their post-partum journey. Joyuus is specifically geared towards providing real-time, evidence-based, actionable health information and resources across physical, mental, and ‘real world’ needs to each of their users. The postpartum period (the first twelve months after giving birth) is critical for both maternal and child health and there are vast racial and ethnic disparities experienced by Black, Latina and other BIPOC women that need to be addressed. We are thrilled that HPE GreenLake, through our partnership with Provdotnet’s Alpha3 Cloud services, is helping provide Joyuus with the right-sized infrastructure platform and cloud services that serve their business needs.

As we close out Women’s History Month, I feel grateful to be part of an organization that has given me the opportunity to work with innovators from all walks of life, and to see women engineers thrive in an industry where they are still underrepresented.

He uses his unique background to build teams that have his back, while he keeps his vision focused on what’s next. We caught up with him to find out just who is Justin Hotard? So, who is Justin Hotard?

I'm someone who's constantly looking ahead at what's next. I’m always scenario planning in my head and thinking about how to put all the puzzle pieces together. I like to solve problems and enjoy the experience of learning.  The way I see it, learning is growing, and I don’t ever want to stop learning. 

Speaking of teams, how did growing up in Europe shape your views on building teams?

I grew up with kids from all over the world - Africa, Europe, the UK and Canada - which gave me the opportunity to be exposed to different cultures.  When I look at bringing together teams, I think about the entire composition of the team. This goes beyond functional expertise, and I believe the best teams are those that bring together different and unique skills. 

What’s the best career advice that you’ve received?

One piece of advice that I’ve lived by is to be genuine and true to yourself. Because if you aren’t being genuine, then people will eventually pick up on that, so be your true self...always. What excites you about supercomputing at HPE?

Just over a year ago, HPE launched the world’s most powerful exascale supercomputer marking a new era in artificial intelligence, scientific research, and innovation that solves calculations up to 10X faster than other top supercomputers.

How can you not get excited about that?

AI has become a hot topic all over the world, what’s most exciting about AI to you?

I would say the potential for AI to improve outcomes in life sciences and healthcare. Too many people suffer and are lost to health issues like terminal illnesses.

Cooperation in a fragmented world: Three goals for the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023,"January 17, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
Cooperation, innovation, and transformation are leading themes at this year’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting
Technology has the opportunity to solve societal problems and advance human progress in a lasting and agile way, but cannot alone support the largescale transformation required
The seemingly never-ending cascade of crises, divisions, and vulnerabilities cannot be solved by a single individual or organization – private and public cooperation is the only way forward","This year’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting convenes at a critical inflection point in our fragmented world 
This week, Pam Carter, Antonio Neri, John Schultz, Justin Hotard, and I are honored to attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting as delegates representing Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In Davos, Switzerland, we are joining over 2,000 business, political, academic, and societal leaders committed to cooperation, innovation, and transformation for the benefit of the planet and her 7.8 billion residents.

This year’s Annual Meeting focuses on cooperation in a fragmented world. We are, by definition, a fragmented society simply by virtue of our backgrounds, lived experiences, cultures, and values. And yet, the most significant achievements in human history, like the triumph over fascism in World War II or putting humans into space – have been possible because despite that fragmentation, we found a way to bridge our differences to advance a common purpose. Today, the seemingly never-ending cascade of crises, heightened geo-economic division and fragmentation, financial sector vulnerabilities, and a spiraling climate crisis, cannot be solved by a single individual or organization – private and public cooperation is the only way forward. The future belongs to the fast, but depends on the cooperative. Technology has the opportunity to solve societal problems and advance human progress in a lasting, agile way – but cannot alone support the largescale transformation required. At this intersection of technology and cooperation that are needed for business and cultural transformation, corporate purpose and a commitment to continual engagement with disparate stakeholders are critical. How we show the world who we are, what we stand for, and what we very personally and accountably will do as brands and leaders determines who we attract as partners, customers, and innovators. This time in Davos presents significant opportunity for me to contribute to and learn from conversations that will support our company, the technology industry, and a global community of brand and reputation professionals. With this context, I arrived yesterday in Davos focused on three personal goals. Explore new collaborations and partnerships that will help Hewlett Packard Enterprise drive meaningful progress to solving the digital divide

By design, Davos convenes entities across public and private sectors to hold constructive and forward-looking dialogues that uncover solutions to unprecedented challenges. This week, I will attend sessions exploring technology platforms, demographic shifts, resource and energy systems, and capitalization. I will participate in conversations about stewarding responsible capitalism, ushering in a new era for value creation in the digital economy, propelling climate action forward, the dangers of disinformation, and the importance of strong cultures that advance business strategies forward.


Through sessions, meetings, and networking opportunities, I hope to find trusted collaborators who, like HPE, are using technology, digital culture, and skills development to help accelerate data-driven innovation. Together, we can uncover opportunities to work together to drive meaningful progress on challenges ranging from the climate crisis to public health to education in 2023 and beyond.
 Inspire and emerge inspired about making the future of work, work for early career talent

Participating in discussions around talent – particularly, early career talent and opportunities for women in technology – will be on my agenda for this year’s Forum. At HPE, we are focused on cultivating early career talent because the candidate pool is digitally native, learns quickly, and is receptive to change. Early career candidates have the foundational skills we need now and will be the leaders of our future. We have to make the future of work, work for them, just like our mentors and former leaders did for those of us now in leadership.

Many young recruits want to build an intentional career dedicated to work that is aligned to their values and vision for how they should contribute to society. While individual definitions of ‘meaningful work’ vary, as global leaders we share a common commitment to creating a diverse, inclusive environment with avenues for ideation and innovation that can lead to lasting societal benefit.

I honestly cannot recall a time in my career when a strong commitment to attracting, motivating, inspiring, and supporting our top talent has been more essential. Our collective ability to emerge from such a chaotic recent past and fuel a promising future depends on it.

Continue to foster a robust community of business leaders with the shared charter of converting reputation and brand loyalty to business performance

It takes a long time to build a reputation, and only an instant to ruin it with a single bad decision. I find it very encouraging and appropriate that Chief Communications Officers attend Davos today, facilitating much-needed dialogue around trust, purpose, and action. The Chief Communications Officer role is often referred to as the conscience of the company. And, our company conscience – our corporate character – increasingly serves as a key differentiator when navigating competitive markets. Brand and reputation are significant considerations when business strategy is formed and evaluated. In Davos, I look forward to interacting with other leading communications, marketing, brand, and corporate affairs leaders to discuss how our profession can continue to be a powerful multiplier of both business performance and societal action.

The last time I was in Davos was 2019, about six months into my tenure at HPE. Four years later, the chance to return is a thrilling one. It’s one of those invigorating business trips where my mind works in overdrive. It’s intellectual stimulation on a whole different level.

Combining a relevant strategy with strong execution to deliver a record-setting Q1 performance,"March 2, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
We have leveraged our strengths to deliver a record-setting first quarter
Our performance reflects the relevance of HPE’s edge-to-cloud strategy
We have generated our highest first quarter revenue since 2016","HPE delivers record-setting Q1 performance and raises fiscal 2023 guidance 
As we report HPE’s first quarter results today, I am extremely pleased with our performance. After delivering an outstanding fourth quarter last year, we leveraged that strength to deliver a record-setting Q1. Our performance reflects the relevance of our strategy that addresses megatrends around edge, cloud and AI. It also shows the transformation of our industry-leading portfolio and the outstanding execution of our team. Here are a few highlights from the quarter:

 

HPE generated our highest Q1 revenue since 2016, with total revenue climbing 18%1 year-over-year to $7.8 billion, significantly above the high end of our outlook.

We again expanded non-GAAP operating margin, this time to a record 11.8%2, up 80 basis points year-over-year.

Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS)2 increased 19% year-over-year to $0.63, our highest ever.

We raised revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance for the full fiscal year, reflecting continued confidence in our long-term strategy and execution. Enhancing innovation through strategic acquisitions

Our differentiated portfolio continues to gain traction. In addition to driving organic innovation across the company, we continue to make strategic acquisitions that enhance what we can offer to our customers. We’ve recently announced several exciting acquisition agreements that complement and expand our offerings, including:

 

Cloud security provider Axis Security, announced today, which will help fortify network security and strengthen our Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions.

Athonet, announced last week, which will place HPE at the forefront of the growing private cellular networking market by creating one of the most complete portfolios in private 5G and wireless connectivity.

TidalScale, announced in Q1, has introduced scalable compute software technologies to our portfolio, adding additional choice points for customers to meet their compute and data-intensive workload needs.

Pachyderm, also announced in Q1, allows us to integrate reproducible AI software with our supercomputing and AI solutions, further expanding our AI-at-scale capabilities.
 

HPE has a successful track record of anticipating what comes next for our customers and investing in innovation that addresses their data-first modernization needs, with an unmatched set of edge-to-cloud solutions.

Driving business momentum

Since we began our edge-to-cloud transformation in 2019, we have consistently grown our as-a-service business, underpinned by the success of our HPE GreenLake platform. The relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both annualized revenue run rate (ARR)3 and our as-a-service total contract value higher. This quarter, we unlocked an impressive $1 billion in ARR for the first time. And over the last two years, we have more than doubled our as-a-service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter.

Impressively, in every one of our key segments during the first quarter, we produced more revenues as well as positive operating profit. Delivering for customers and shareholders

I am very proud of how our HPE team members have executed to achieve this quarter’s exceptional performance, especially given the uneven macro environment. We have kicked off fiscal 2023 with another set of standout results, positioning us very well to deliver a very strong business performance for the full fiscal year.

We look forward to the rest of the fiscal year, as we continue to be laser-focused on executing our winning strategy, creating unmatched innovation, and delivering significant results for our customers and shareholders.

This makes for HPE’s continuous 14 years of recognition as a Leader by Gartner. A Magic Quadrant provides a graphical competitive positioning of four types of technology providers, in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct: Leaders execute well against their current vision and are well positioned for tomorrow; Visionaries understand where the market is going or have a vision for changing market rules, but do not yet execute well; Niche Players focus successfully on a small segment, or are unfocused and do not out-innovate or outperform others; Challengers execute well today or may dominate a large segment, but do not demonstrate an understanding of market direction.

"Strategic shift toward edge, hybrid cloud and AI delivers solid results in Q3","August 29, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
HPE increased Q3 revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share year-over-year
Results driven by intentional shift to higher-growth, higher-margin parts of our portfolio
Exceptional performance in the Intelligent Edge and HPE GreenLake fueled performance
Demand grew sequentially across all key  business segments, led by interest in AI and HPE GreenLake","Revenue growth and gross margin expansion driven by outstanding peformance in Intelligent Edge and HPE GreenLake
Today, HPE reported third quarter financial performance, and I am pleased that we have delivered another solid quarter. In an IT market that is still pressured in some areas, we again increased our revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, year-over-year. Our results are being driven by our intentional, ongoing shift to higher-growth, higher-margin parts of our portfolio. We delivered exceptional performance in the Intelligent Edge, where revenue set its fifth consecutive quarterly record, and HPE GreenLake, which has helped generate higher recurring revenue and gross profit across our product segments. Demand for our products and services grew sequentially in the third quarter across all business segments – driven by high-growth areas like AI and HPE GreenLake. 

Highlights from the quarter include:

 

HPE grew revenue 3.5%(1) year-over-year to $7.0 billion.

Non-GAAP gross margin(2) rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%, very close to the record level we achieved in the second quarter.

Higher profitability resulted in a 2% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share(2) to 49 cents.

We generated $955 million dollars in free cash flow – an increase of nearly $370 million year-over-year.

We once again raised non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.
Driving financial performance through HPE GreenLake 

Our strategic shift toward edge, hybrid cloud and AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake platform is working, generating higher recurring revenue and gross profit– driven by the increased mix of high-margin software and services. In Q3, HPE GreenLake delivered an annualized revenue run-rate (ARR)(3) of $1.3 billion, a 48%(1) increase year-over-year. As we grow our ARR, we are also increasing its share of high-margin software and services, which comprised 68% of our total ARR mix, up two percentage points from last quarter. HPE GreenLake continues to attract new customers – and compel existing customers to expand their contracts, with the platform now supporting 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices. HPE GreenLake orders rose 122% year-over-year, resulting in a nearly $1.5 billion increase in as-a-service total contract value (TCV)(4) since last quarter. Our cumulative booked TCV now stands at nearly $12 billion. 

These results demonstrate the relevance of our HPE GreenLake value proposition of providing one unified hybrid-cloud experience to empower customers to access, analyze and extract value from their data – no matter where it lives – at the edge, in their colos or datacenter, or in the public cloud. 

Exceptional performance in the Intelligent Edge

HPE’s performance in the Intelligent Edge segment was particularly noteworthy in the quarter.  Revenue increased 53%(1) year-over-year and contributed 20% of our total company revenue. Operating profit more than doubled in another exceptional quarter for this business; it is now the largest source of HPE’s operating profit, at 49% of our total segment operating profit(2).

We are gaining share, benefiting from improved availability of supply, higher shipment volume, and a strong response to our SaaS edge offerings in terms of both demand and revenue. Momentum in Intelligent Edge was consistent around the globe, with revenue increasing by double digits year-over-year in all regions in the third quarter. 

Wave of demand in HPC & AI

We continue to see strong interest in our AI and supercomputing offerings from enterprise customers who are incorporating artificial intelligence into their businesses. This is translating into significantly higher demand for our HPC & AI business segment, as customers choose HPE for our unique end-to-end AI value proposition. As a result, we exited the quarter with the largest HPC & AI order book we have ever had. Our AI momentum has also helped grow our total HPE order book, which is now at more than two times pre-pandemic levels, driven by exceptional customer demand for our AI solutions. Only HPE can combine our unique AI software and Slingshot networking fabric, HPE Services offerings, and market-leading sustainable supercomputers, which power unprecedented levels of performance for AI at scale. Our open ecosystem of AI suppliers is also an advantage for customers, who are turning to us for a full spectrum of enterprise AI workloads and use cases – spanning large-scale model development, training and inferencing.

We are seeing AI projects generate exciting results on our supercomputers. For example, the HPE-built LUMI supercomputer, the fastest system in Europe and third fastest in the world, has enabled generative AI projects, such as creating the world’s largest Finnish language model, and has helped researchers apply AI for early detection of diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers.

And we continue to make progress in ushering in the era of exascale supercomputing, which enables unprecedented scale and performance for larger AI models, such as generative AI. This quarter, HPE, in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, started to build and test El Capitan, one of the largest upcoming exascale supercomputers. El Capitan, which is expected to reach 2 exaflops of peak performance, will allow researchers to apply AI to advance U.S. national security and make breakthroughs in medical and drug research initiatives. 

Shift to software- and services-rich businesses delivers for shareholders

Our third quarter performance demonstrates the progress we have made to shift our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin areas that are the most critical to customers as they continue to transform. Our pivot to software- and services-rich businesses has led to greater recurring revenue, margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. 

Despite a slowdown in some parts of the IT industry, our HPE team has executed our strategy, bringing differentiated innovation and a diverse portfolio to our customers around the globe. This positions us to continue to win in the market and deliver for our shareholders.

"Creating the future together with new innovation across edge, cloud and AI","June 23, 2023","IN THIS ARTICLE
This year’s HPE Discover marked my sixth keynote on its stage. Since my first day as CEO, I said the enterprise of the future would be edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven. That vision turned to strategy, then innovation, and ultimately into business outcomes for customers in every industry
On-stage in front of 10,000 attendees, I made one of the most transformational announcements in our company’s history: Hewlett Packard Enterprise is entering the A.I. public cloud market
In my discussions with customers, partners, press, industry analysts, and HPE team members this week, they reaffirmed that our edge-to-cloud strategy and differentiated innovation like the announcements we made this week continue to set us apart
We stand in a league of our own at an incredible technology inflection point, where edge, hybrid cloud, and now AI – will come together to advance the way we all live and work","At HPE, we are preparing our customers and partners to take advantage of advanced technologies across edge, hybrid cloud and A.I. that enable us to uncover insight and drive action like never before
This week, I was happy to have the opportunity to gather with 10,000 Hewlett Packard Enterprise customers and partners, and team members for our annual HPE Discover event.  The energy was electric as we introduced incredible new innovation and discussed new ways HPE’s edge-to-cloud portfolio can help customers harness the power of their data to advance their digital transformations.

As I reflect on the week’s conversations, it is clear we are entering a new era, driven by one of the most exciting technologies the world has ever seen: artificial intelligence. It will affect every industry, as well as every level of computing, from the smallest IoT device to the largest exascale supercomputer. And it will require that enterprises be edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven – characteristics I asserted would define the enterprise of the future when I became CEO more than five years ago.  At HPE, we are preparing our customers and partners to take advantage of advanced technologies across edge, hybrid cloud and A.I. that enable us to uncover insight and drive action like never before.

Edge: Leveraging data with the most intelligent, secure, and advanced networking portfolio

We all know how data is exploding at the edge. In 2018, we declared the edge would be the next frontier, and since then, we have invested more than $5.5 billion to build the world’s best, most intelligent, secure, and advanced networking portfolio with more than 27 million HPE Aruba access points in the field, and more than 3,600 customers of our SD-WAN solutions, powered by our Silver Peak acquisition.

Making it all work efficiently and at scale requires smart and A.I.-enhanced predictive management tools, as well as end-to-end security. Our acquisition of Axis Security, an industry leader in SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) is helping us address the convergence of the network and security markets, and the ongoing build-out of the hybrid cloud.

Our newest data center infrastructure products, led by the HPE Aruba CX 10000 switch, are key to tying resources together and offer a unique blend of performance, scale, and automation. We are also leading the convergence of wireless technologies, thanks to our acquisition of Athonet, will power a seamless experience across Private 5G and W-Fi.

Today, all of our HPE Aruba Networking offerings are cloud subscription-based and available on our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. Together, they provide the simplicity to deploy connectivity at scale through an intuitive cloud operating experience.

Hybrid Cloud: HPE GreenLake services for every enterprise

For years, I have said the world would be hybrid – and that prediction has come true as businesses seek to blend the best of on-premises and public-cloud resources. It’s a powerful mix but it’s hard to get it right.  Organizations need a unified experience across all workloads that is open and secure, as well as sustainable. HPE GreenLake is the core of that experience.

At HPE Discover, we extended our hybrid cloud leadership with new HPE GreenLake cloud services, including SaaS solutions from recent acquisition OpsRamp and for backup and machine learning, as well as expanded NaaS offerings.

Of course, no hybrid cloud strategy is complete without coherent integration with the public cloud. We have expanded HPE’s relationship with AWS to simplify the hybrid cloud transformation for enterprises. And for private cloud workloads, to drive faster, easier, and more sustainable ways to deploy HPE GreenLake outside your data center, we have significantly expanded our partnership with colo market leader, Equinix. The partnership enables customers to go from quote to production in just days, adding capacity and scale on-demand. We’re also expanding our HPE GreenLake private cloud portfolio with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, a new offering that allows customers to spin up virtual machines across hybrid clouds on demand. 

A.I.: The next great frontier

We have all seen how newly-available A.I. tools can give businesses superpowers – of insight, speed, capacity, and efficiency. A.I. is the most disruptive technology of our lifetimes, and we are at the inflection point of its application.

An opportunity of this magnitude requires an appropriately-scaled response. So, we made one of the biggest announcements we have ever made on the HPE Discover stage.

We believe that powerful and trusted A.I. training tools must be accessible to all organizations. We’re making that possible by entering the A.I. cloud market.

We’re using our industry-leading supercomputing to power our new service, HPE GreenLake for Large Language Models. It will enable any enterprise to privately train, tune, and deploy large-scale A.I. through our on-demand supercomputing cloud service.

We built HPE GreenLake for LLM in partnership with Aleph Alpha, using its pre-trained Luminous model. The service can work with customers’ private data sets to create LLMs in five languages. Models can be trained from scratch and then deployed for private (or public) use. It’s the ideal solution for creating generative A.I. models based on proprietary data: unlike consumer-grade models, your data remains yours. And it is the first in a series of industry- and domain-specific A.I. applications that HPE plans to launch in the future, including climate modeling, healthcare and financial services. Performance, speed and accuracy are all essential when pursuing A.I. But one other critical consideration is the sustainability impact of A.I. workloads. Energy efficiency must be embedded into A.I. strategies. HPE GreenLake for LLM will run in sustainable colocation facilities. These facilities include sophisticated direct liquid-cooling capabilities and waste-heat reuse initiatives as part of the solution that can make the footprint carbon negative. Creating the future together

The last week has been invigorating.  Our customers and partners realize we are at a technology inflection point, and they are turning to HPE to help them power new possibilities across edge, hybrid cloud and A.I.

HPE has been at the forefront of major technology advancements over the last 80 years. It is a privilege to bring new ground-breaking innovation to our customers and partners, so we can come together to advance the way people live and work.

How a coding competition can lead to a career in tech,"March 6, 2023",,"Drew Neyland, former CodeWars student, now a software engineer at HPE, tells us how friendly competitions can spark a career
For 26 years, HPE has hosted CodeWars, a first-class computer programming competition for high school students. The event invites teams of students aged between 13 and 18 years old, sponsored by their teachers and schools, to compete against one another to solve coding problems.

Student are encouraged to push their problem-solving limits, while HPE volunteers their tech talent to help mentor these students to see past this challenge and explore a career in tech.

We caught up with one former student, Drew Neyland, who followed his passion for problem solving and is now a software engineer at HPE, to tell us how competitions like CodeWars can spark a career.
 

How did you learn about CodeWars? How many years did you participate?

I learned about CodeWars when I was a freshman in high school from my computer science teacher. I enjoyed the programming I was doing, but I knew nothing about any kind of formal competitions. I participated for three years - 2009, 2011 and 2012.


How do you think having access to programs like this shaped your career goals? Did you know what you wanted to be, before having access to coding?

I had absolutely no clue what I wanted to do before I got access to coding. Admittedly, I was in middle school when I had my first brush with it. After about two or three years of participating in competitions like CodeWars, I sat down with my computer one Saturday to work on practice problems. The problems led to me wanting to code a game and before I knew it, I’d missed lunch and dinner because I was so engrossed in what I was doing.  What have you learned from participating in the challenge – what were your biggest takeaways?

One of my biggest takeaways was learning how much programming is done before you write a line of code or put your hands on the keyboard. You need to understand a problem, break it up, and then formulate the methods of how to solve it. If you’re writing code before you’ve solved the problem, you’re going to be hundreds of lines of code deep in a problem and realize you can’t make the ends meet up because of something you didn’t consider in the beginning.


Why do you still take an active part in CodeWars?

This is my first year volunteering, but I do think there is something about trying to solve as many problems as you can in a tight time limit that exponentially increases your learning, more so than I found just listening to lectures or from reading. It provides an opportunity for students to apply what they’ve learned and interact with other people around them who have the same interests.

What advice do you have for students who aren’t sure if coding is something they can do?


Spend time investing in your problem-solving skills, and explore solving those problems without worrying about a programming language. Just write out the simplest steps to solve a given problem that can be used to solve the problem repeatedly, independent of a given data set. Once you’ve developed those ‘muscles,’ then pick up a simple language like Java or Python and see if you can translate those steps into code.

Those problem-solving skills can transfer to the different programming languages you’ll learn along the way.",https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/blog-post/2023/03/how-a-coding-competition-can-lead-to-a-career-in-tech.html,"['How did CodeWars help you develop your problem-solving skills?', 'What was the most challenging problem you had to solve during the competition?', 'How did you apply the skills you learned from CodeWars in your career as a software engineer?']","[' CodeWars helped Drew Neyland develop his problem-solving skills by encouraging him to push his limits and providing him with opportunities to apply what he had learned. He learned how to break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts and formulate methods for solving them. This helped him become a more efficient and effective problem solver, which in turn helped him excel in his career as a software engineer at HPE.', "" The most challenging problem Drew Neyland had to solve during the CodeWars competition was one that required him to understand a problem, break it up, and then formulate the methods of how to solve it.

He emphasized the importance of understanding a problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and formulating methods to solve it before writing any code. This approach helped him to write efficient and effective code, which was crucial in his role as a software engineer. Additionally, Drew found that the competitive nature of CodeWars helped him to develop his problem-solving skills and work well under pressure, which were valuable skills in his career.']"

1 A description of HPE’s use of non-GAAP financial information is provided below under “Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics.”  2 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (“ARR”) is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.  3 Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E) and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.  4 Non-GAAP operating profit excludes costs of approximately $0.9 billion primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.  5 Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis. In reliance on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the Company cannot predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These elements could have a material impact on the Company’s reported GAAP results for the guidance period. Refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information.

Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics       To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures, including revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and free cash flow. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental useful information to investors is included further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit (earnings from operations), operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, and cash flow from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.  In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents annualized revenue run-rate (""ARR"") and as-a-Service (""AAS"") orders as performance metrics. ARR is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income for operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS""), software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. AAS orders are an overlay across all business segments contributing to HPE's consumption-based services (both recurring and non-recurring revenues), and includes hardware, as well as HPE GreenLake as-a-Service, Aruba SaaS, Storage SaaS, and other Software assets. ARR & AAS orders should be viewed independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these items.  Forward-looking statements  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(1)   The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $905 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI and Software reporting units was below the carrying value of their net assets. Software is under the Corporate Investments and Other reportable segment.  (2)   Represents the amortization of basis difference adjustments related to H3C. The twelve months ended October 31, 2023 also included the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C of $8 million.  (3)   Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. This resulted in the transfer of certain storage networking products, previously reported within the Storage reportable segment, to the Compute reportable segment. The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the transfer of net revenue and operating profit for each of the businesses as described above. These changes had no impact on the Company's previously reported consolidated results.  (4)   Diluted net earnings per share reflects any dilutive effect of restricted stock awards, stock options and performance based awards, but the effect is excluded when calculating GAAP diluted net loss per share because it would be anti-dilutive.
Use of non-GAAP financial measures  To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures including revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and free cash flow.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.  Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors  Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing the non-GAAP financial measures stated above in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information provides Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors with a supplemental view to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates the comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.  Economic substance of and material limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise  Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating the past and future performance of the Company, without the impact of foreign exchange rates. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and disaster charges. Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) and non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) consist of earnings from operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue excluding those same charges above and charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding the charges previously stated, as well as tax indemnification and other adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit cost (credit), earnings from equity interests, impairment of investment, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental view to management and investors of the consolidated financial performance of the Company without costs that Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting their use as analytical tools.  These limitations are discussed below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 
•      Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as the Company elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, the Company did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore the Company excludes these costs. Exclusion of these costs can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and HPE Financial Services segment results.  
•      Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses and the Company’s internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset amortization. Amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represents the loss in value of intangible assets over time and can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.  
•      Transformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform the Company’s IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real-estate identified as part of the initiatives. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as they are discrete costs related to two specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017 and 2020, respectively, as multi-year programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure following material divestiture transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product portfolio in fiscal 2020. The primary elements of the HPE Next and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially completed by October 31, 2023. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from the non-GAAP measures, as stated above, is to provide a supplemental measure of the Company’s operating results that do not include material HPE Next Plan and Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as the Company’s management does not believe such costs to be reflective of the ongoing operating cost structure. Further, the transformation costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have been materially declining since 2021 and are not expected to be material beyond fiscal 2023. Hewlett Packard Enterprises management believes that non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to management and investors for comparing operating performance across multiple periods.  
•      Disaster charges are primarily related to the exit of the Company’s businesses in Russia and Belarus and include credit losses of financing receivables and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. Disaster charges also include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and subsequent shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes Disaster charges from these non-GAAP measures as the specific charges are non-recurring charges and not indicative of the operational performance of the Company’s business.  
•      Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses, and internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and competitors present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation expense.  
•      Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges. The charges are direct expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs as these expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of acquisitions and divestitures, and internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation expense.  
•      Tax indemnification and other adjustments are primarily related to changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which Hewlett Packard Enterprise remains liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.  
•      Non-service net periodic benefit cost/credit includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and considers them to be outside the operational performance of the business.  
•      Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, this adjustment also included the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.  
•         In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, HPE recorded an impairment charge for an equity investment resulting from a permanent reduction of the investee’s assets. This adjustment was reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HPE believes eliminating the impairment of investment for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.  
•         Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to the Company’s operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise operates. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company used a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.  
•      Free cash flow (“FCF”) is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E) and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management and investors can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in the Company’s businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating historical and prospective liquidity.  Compensation for material limitations with use of non-GAAP financial measures
 These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets. Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this quarter and prior periods within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.",,,

"HPE Spaceborne Computer program: The incredible journey of a computer at the farthest edge
","January 29, 2024","N THIS ARTICLE
Ahead of a third launch into space, we take a look back at HPE's journey in designing a computer at the farthest edge – space
HPE Spaceborne Computer-2 delivers data center performance and targeted AI capabilities to meet in-orbit data processing needs and advance space exploration

As the HPE Spaceborne Computer program celebrates its third journey to the International Space Station, let us take a look back at the various design and maintenance challenges faced by HPE and NASA in the system’s creation.  There is no such thing as a straightforward journey to space for a computer operated at the farthest edge. From an off-the-shelf HPE Apollo 40 server used in Spaceborne Computer-1 to the HPE Edgeline EL4000 and HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen10 servers powering the Spaceborne Computer-2, HPE engineers and researchers had to iterate and learn on-the-go to meet the highest standards of NASA.
There is no such thing as a straightforward journey to space for a computer operated at the farthest edge 
These are some of the unforeseen challenges HPE faced throughout our journey sending a powerful computing system to space.  Put a square peg in a round hole  “Well, I suggest you gentlemen then find a way to put a square peg in a round hole”. This cult line from Gene Kranz's character in ""Apollo 13"" sums up the very first challenge that HPE faced in designing HPE Spaceborne Computer.  On Earth, datacenter components are rectangular in shape to optimize space when racked. The orbiting station however, is an assembly of modules in a cylindrical shape. The design of HPE Spaceborne Computer thus started with an exercise of design and geometry in order to make four-sided shapes into circles. This included the creation of a custom chassis and novel sideways installation.  Assembly and maintenance by astronauts  To enable IT-savvy customers to resolve issues or do routine maintenance on Earth, HPE delivers replacement parts along with instructions on how to install them. A common practice for handling objects is to grab, pull or lift.  In space, however, weightlessness requires an astronaut to stabilize themself by holding on to several fixed points. It is impossible for an astronaut to follow Earth-made instructions at the risk of pushing themself across the space station. Therefore, even before the launch of Spaceborne Computer, all the operation and maintenance manuals were revised to meet NASA space standards for the crew members.

Proven in space, available on Earth  In space, every being and thing floats if it is not attached to a fixed point. While HPE's experts had the foresight to create structure docking to prevent the first HPE Spaceborne Computer from floating freely on the space station, they did not fully anticipate all the consequences the lack of gravity had on the inner parts. Without gravity, unattached components will float inside the chassis, including internal wiring. These wires ventured too close to the system’s cooling fans, which sanded the wires down over time, producing and releasing dust inside the system that was later caught by filters.  The HPE team created and immediately implemented a solution to secure the wires for HPE Spaceborne Computer-2. Additionally, the team documented the issue and solution, submitting it for consideration in future product designs, encompassing components in vehicles and other moving objects, including those on Earth.  Reaching the space station  Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. The space station is a non-geostationary object and completes a revolution of the Earth about every 90 minutes. As such, it only has a maximum of two satellites pointing at it at any given time of day. And there are points in time when communication with Earth is not possible.  As soon as communications with the space station comes back online, everyone on Earth wants to reach it, which reduces the already stressed bandwidth and affects astronauts in their capacity to conduct research. This bottlenecking is among the strongest proof points supporting the need for edge computing in space.  A physical device on the space station that sequences DNA locally generates 22GB of data each time. Rather than send all 22GB of data to Earth, the HPE Spaceborne Computer processed the data onboard, ultimately producing an output file that was 235KB, reducing the amount of time it takes to share research insights between space and Earth.
From zero to zero-gravity in 13 months
From the drawing board to space in 13 months  The first iteration of HPE Spaceborne Computer, which is retroactively referred to as HPE Spaceborne Computer-1, was one of the most time-constrained projects HPE ever faced. From zero to zero-gravity in 13 months. Ultimately, some components and ideas were abandoned. In response to suggestions from NASA and the crew, our experts optimized HPE Spaceborne Computer-2 and added new features. One of these improvements included adding 10 gigabit Ethernet. And while generally, HPE considers USB ports on data center hardware a vulnerability that should be avoided, the space station is not exactly your typical data center. Since the crew has a need to analyze data frequently, external USB ports were also added to HPE Spaceborne Computer-2.  After two successful trips to the International Space Station, the latest iteration of this system has added over 130 TB of flash-based storage, the most to ever travel to the space station on a single mission. Thanks to our collaborators at KIOXIA, this addition means it will be possible to run new types of applications and conduct research using larger data sets, this includes the ability to run more artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads.  We look forward to sharing new insights and revelations from this third tour to space while yet again providing the international scientific community access to high performance computing and data center-level AI/ML processing capabilities in space.","N THIS ARTICLE

Additionally, the team documented the issue and solution, submitting it for consideration in future product designs, encompassing components in vehicles and other moving objects, including those on Earth.  Reaching the space station  Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. The space station is a non-geostationary object and completes a revolution of the Earth about every 90 minutes. As such, it only has a maximum of two satellites pointing at it at any given time of day. And there are points in time when communication with Earth is not possible.  As soon as communications with the space station comes back online, everyone on Earth wants to reach it, which reduces the already stressed bandwidth and affects astronauts in their capacity to conduct research. This bottlenecking is among the strongest proof points supporting the need for edge computing in space.  A physical device on the space station that sequences DNA locally generates 22GB of data each time. Rather than send all 22GB of data to Earth, the HPE Spaceborne Computer processed the data onboard, ultimately producing an output file that was 235KB, reducing the amount of time it takes to share research insights between space and Earth.
From zero to zero-gravity in 13 months
From the drawing board to space in 13 months  The first iteration of HPE Spaceborne Computer, which is retroactively referred to as HPE Spaceborne Computer-1, was one of the most time-constrained projects HPE ever faced. From zero to zero-gravity in 13 months. Ultimately, some components and ideas were abandoned. In response to suggestions from NASA and the crew, our experts optimized HPE Spaceborne Computer-2 and added new features. One of these improvements included adding 10 gigabit Ethernet. And while generally, HPE considers USB ports on data center hardware a vulnerability that should be avoided, the space station is not exactly your typical data center. Since the crew has a need to analyze data frequently, external USB ports were also added to HPE Spaceborne Computer-2.  After two successful trips to the International Space Station, the latest iteration of this system has added over 130 TB of flash-based storage, the most to ever travel to the space station on a single mission. Thanks to our collaborators at KIOXIA, this addition means it will be possible to run new types of applications and conduct research using larger data sets, this includes the ability to run more artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads.  We look forward to sharing new insights and revelations from this third tour to space while yet again providing the international scientific community access to high performance computing and data center-level AI/ML processing capabilities in space.",,,
